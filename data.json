"title": "'Flash Freeze' postmortem: Protecting markets from hackers ", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Thomas Samson | AFP | Getty Images Nasdaq officials say a 'connectivity' problem was what shut down trading for three hours Thursday, but some cybersecurity experts are concerned that hackers may see an opportunity to attack the markets. 'This draws attention to a system that we know,' said Alex McGeorge, a senior security researcher at Immunity Inc. 'Even if this wasn't a malicious attack, this has some redundancy issuesmeaning it is probably ripe for having some other types of security vulnerabilities.' The stock exchanges could implement a few key changes to enhance security, he said. Read more: Cramer: Nasdaq was 'WRONG WRONG WRONG' The Securities and Exchange Commission is working on new regulations for market technology. Only voluntary standardssome dating back to the 1980sare in place now. 'Those standards reflect the time in which they were written. ... I think there needs to be an update, especially to address what we know about computer security, how we know attackers operate today,' McGeorge said. The exchanges have pushed back against regulation. But after the 'Flash Freeze' on Thursday, the Nasdaq CEO Robert Greifield seemed more open to the SEC's proposals. 'When you look at the details of the rules, there's always ways to quibble,' he told CNBC. 'But the pure spirit of the rules are there, and we think we ought to go further on this concept of defensive driving.' Watch: Greifield on the Nasdaq Nightmare McGeorge, who has been working in cybersecurity for the financial industry since 2008, said that the industry must take a broader view of the expense. While cybersecurity can be a big investment, the costs of an attack are far greater. For example, he said, 'the PlayStation network that's delivered by Sony a very large network, had significant downtime, months, because of a security breach.' If the same kind of thing were to happen to the exchanges, 'I don't know if the economy could deal with something like this,' he added. Watch: Is Wall Street prepared for a cyberwar? According to McGeorge, regulators and stock exchanges can take a few specific measures to increase cybersecurity. For one, financial networks need to be better segregated. Thousands of people and firms need to access critical systems daily. Each person is a point of vulnerability. 'If I can compromise one of the users of this system, that gives me an avenue to attack the system itself,' McGeorge said. Stock exchanges also need more redundancies, or backups, he said. The Nasdaq glitch occurred when the central system for reporting pricesknown as the securities information processor, or SIPwas compromised. Greifeld told CNBC that the Nasdaq would be open to allowing competitors to set up SIPs of their own. That way if a system goes down, firms would have an alternative source for pricing information. Five Ways Markets Can Protect Themselves from Hacker CNBC's Scott Cohn reports that while there is no evidence that hackers caused this week's NASDAQ shutdown, experts are concerned about the cybersecurity of US markets. Hacking America presents five ways to ensure US stock exchanges are more secure. The SEC should require the financial industry to have third parties test its networks, McGeorge said, adding that he performs such tests for Immunity. Read more: Yes, you can. Teaching children to hack safely 'Anything that's connected to an exchange has to undergo regular, manual third-party assessment,' he said. 'Nothing scripted or automated, because ... people willing to go through to this length to attack an exchange are going to doing it manually.'

"title": "Amgen close to buying Onyx for $125 per share", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " AP Amgen is close to buying Onyx Pharmaceuticals for $125 per share, or more than $10 billion, in a deal that is expected to be announced as soon as Monday, two people familiar with the matter said on Saturday. A deal, which is still being finalized and would require board approval from both companies, would represent the fifth-largest biotechnology deal in history. The proposed takeover would value Onyx at 13 times the company's expected revenues for next year, one of the richest valuations in biotech takeovers, one of the people said. The people asked not to be identified because the matter is not public. Representatives for Amgen and Onyx could not be immediately reached for comment. The acquisition of Onyx would give Amgen full rights to Kyprolis, the new multiple myeloma drug that analysts expect to reach annual peak sales in excess of $2 billion. Amgen would also gain a revenue stream from the liver and kidney cancer drug Nexavar that Onyx shares with Bayer AG, as well as royalty payments on Bayer's much newer colon cancer drug Stivarga and potential future royalties on an experimental breast cancer drug being developed by Pfizer. A deal in the $10 billion range would be Amgen's biggest since its $16 billion acquisition of Immunex in 2001 that gave it the rheumatoid arthritis drug, Enbrel, which is one of Amgen's most important, biggest-selling products. It would be by far the biggest deal under CEO Bob Bradway, who took over the top spot in May 2012. He has done a handful of much smaller deals, the biggest to date being a $1.16 billion acquisition of Micromet. Focus on oncology Onyx shares closed at $116.96 on Friday. Amgen offered to pay $120 per share for the company in June but Onyx said that bid significantly undervalued the company and put itself up for sale. An Onyx deal would also give Amgen a much higher profile in oncology. Several of its current drugs offer supportive care for cancer patients, such as to treat anemia or decreases in white blood cells caused by chemotherapy. Another of its newer medicines, Xgeva, helps prevent fractures in patients whose cancers have spread to the bone. Its one product that treats cancer, the colon cancer drug Vectibix, has largely been a disappointment. Analysts are expecting Onyx revenue to reach $878 million in 2014, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Geoffrey Porges, long-time biotech analyst for Sanford Bernstein, projected that an Onyx acquisition would boost Amgen revenue by 5 percent to 6 percent near term, rising to 20 percent by 2021. He sees Amgen EPS declining by 3 percent to 4 percent in 2014 with the purchase of Onyx, but increasing by 8 percent in 2016 and growing to an increase of 22 percent in 2019. Two of Amgen's biggest products - the anemia drugs Aranesp and Epogen - have been in decline for years, while others are fairly mature at this point. The New York Times first reported on Saturday that the two companies were near a deal. "

"title": "Japan nuclear operator raises alarm on crisis", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Japan Pool| AFP| Getty Images The operator of Japan's tsunami-hit nuclear power plant sounded the alarm on the gravity of the deepening crisis of containment at the coastal site on Friday, saying that there are more than 200,000 tons of radioactive water in makeshift tanks vulnerable to leaks, with no reliable way to check on them or anywhere to transfer the water. The latest disclosures add to a long list of recent accidents, leaks and breakdowns that have underscored grave vulnerabilities at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant site more than two years after a powerful earthquake and tsunami set off meltdowns at three reactors. They come two weeks after the prime minister, Shinzo Abe, promised that his government would take a more active role in the site's cleanup, raising questions over how seriously he has taken that pledge. Mr. Abe's government has continued to push for a restart of the country's nuclear power program, and he heads to the Middle East on Saturday to promote Japanese exports to the region, including nuclear technology. Mr. Abe also plans to lead Tokyo's delegation to Argentina for the International Olympic Committee's final vote, set for Sept. 7, on the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo, 150 miles south of the stricken nuclear power plant, is one of three finalists competing to host the games. The others are Istanbul and Madrid. How Japan really feels about nuclear power Two years after the Fukushima disaster, Japanese residents remain strongly opposed to the restarting of nuclear power capacity. CNBC's Sri Jegarajah traveled to the area filed this report. Opposition lawmakers here have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency. ''The nuclear crisis is real and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way,'' said Yoshiko Kira of the opposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month. ''The government should declare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow of contaminated water,'' Ms. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe's office in Tokyo. More from the New York Times Tank Has Leaked Tons of Contaminated Water at Japan Nuclear Site Syrian Kurds Find More Than a Refuge in Northern Iraq Lockdown by Government Smothers Day of Planned Protest in Egypt Mr. Abe remains popular, and it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant will become for him. But it has become increasingly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric Power Company, or Tepco, to handle. Tepco has built nearly 1,000 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of contaminated water, the product of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating, and groundwater pouring into their breached basements at a rate of 400 tons a day. This week, Tepco said one tank had sprung a huge leak. On Friday, Tepco presented an even starker view of the situation, acknowledging that as much as 220,000 tons of that water is stored in makeshift steel tanks similar to the one that is leaking. The operator said the 36-foot-tall cylindrical tanks, meant as a temporary repository for the growing amount of radiated water at the complex, used vulnerable rubber sealing and that their ability to withstand radiation was not tested. The tanks are susceptible to leaks at the seams and through their concrete base, said Noriyuki Imaizumi, the acting general manager of Tepco's nuclear power division. A nearby drain can carry any leaked water to the sea, Mr. Imaizumi said, and high radiation readings along a section suggest that water has already traveled through the drain to the ocean. The makeshift tanks also lack water level gauges, making it difficult to detect leaks. Only two workers are assigned to checking nearly 1,000 tanks on two-hour patrols twice a day, Mr. Imaizumi said. The Nuclear Regulation Authority, which the Japanese government ordered to more actively advise and monitor Tepco's activities at the plant, had told the company to begin transferring the water from the makeshift tanks to better-built vessels. But after visiting the plant on Friday, an authority commissioner, Toyoshi Fuketa, said the vast quantities made doing so quickly ''unrealistic.'' A series of pits Tepco dug to store some of the water also began leaking earlier this year, forcing workers to transfer the water into the steel tanks. Experts have said they suspect that more contaminated water is seeping out from under the melted-down reactors into the groundwater and the Pacific. Elevated levels of radioactive cesium in surrounding waters seem to confirm those suspicions. Tepco has said those leaks are not directly from beneath the reactors, but from maintenance tunnels that run along the coast and remain contaminated from the early days of the disaster. But it also acknowledges that the water beneath the reactors is extremely contaminated, and experts say that if it does get into the ocean, it will surpass even the leaks that occurred in the disaster's early days. ''That prospect scares me,'' Michio Aoyama, a senior scientist in the Oceanography and Geochemistry Research Department at the government-affiliated Meteorological Research Institute, said in an interview this month. ''It's the ultimate, worst-case scenario,'' Professor Aoyama said. "

Just spend a minute to give yourself a quick financial checkup. Review your bank balances. Pay a bill or two. Contact your bank, credit card company or lender for a quick check on an issue that kept you awake last night. Read more from TODAY.com:For the love of work: Most would stay on job after lottery winWorried about finances, some parents opt for 'one and done'Find money owed to you from old accounts There may be dozens of financial questions you wish you had answers too. I tackled a few for viewers live on the plaza at The TODAY Show. In our 'Money in a Minute' segment, I took questions from the audience on topics ranging from retirement savings to college planning. Here are a few of my answerswith a little more information than I could get to in 60 seconds ... Question: Should your savings be in a 401 as opposed to a college education plan for your kids when saving for college?Kerry, 47, Maine. Sharon's answer: A 529 plan is a far better option for college savings than a 401 or workplace retirement plan. You should put money for college in an account that is earmarked for college, not in your retirement account. Remember if you rob your 401 to pay for college there won't be any scholarships or financial aid to help you cover your expenses in retirement. Keep your retirement money for yourselfand fund a 529 plan for your child. What's great about a 529 college savings plan is that the after-tax money you invest in this account can be withdrawn tax-free to pay for tuition, room and board, fees and other college-related expenses. Plus, many states will offer you a state tax deduction for your contributions. Find out more about 529 plans at www.savingforcollege.com. Also, don't feel pressured to foot the entire bill for your child's college education. Parents should view saving forand paying forcollege as a family affair. Your child can apply for scholarships, grants and other financial aid. High school and college students can work while in school and save some of their pay for college, just as you do. Your child may also have to take out loans, but can reduce the overall debt load by choosing a more affordable college. Find out more about saving and paying for college at www.collegeanswer.com. DNY59 | E+ | Getty Images Question: I'm in my 30s and I'm afraid I am not putting away enough for retirement. What do I do to make sure I'm on track?Leslie, 31, New Britain, Conn. Sharon's answer: Starting to save for retirement in your 20s or 30s will put you much further on the path toward being financially secure later in life. Still, figuring out how much to save for retirement at any age can be daunting. Generally, saving at least 10 to 15 percent of your gross income for retirement is a great place to start. You may need to increase that to 20 percent or more depending on how much money you will ultimately need to meet your expenses in your 60s and beyond. If you have a 401 retirement plan at work, make sure you are contributing at least up to the company's matching contribution. Your company may contribute 50 cents or more for every dollar you contribute to the planthat's free money! Don't miss out! Overall, you can contribute a maximum of $17,500 to a 401 this year. The money that you put into a 401 comes out of your pay before taxes, so you're also lowering your taxable income. You can also save for retirement on your own through an IRA. Roth IRAs, in particular, are great vehicles for retirement savings. You put in after-tax dollars but can take out the money tax-free after age 59 You can contribute up to $5,500 in a Roth IRA this year. By CNBC's Sharon Epperson.

"title": "Time for market to start worrying about Septemberyikes!", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Wepix | E+ | Getty Images August has been rough enough on markets, but navigating what's ahead in September could be more than a little scary.September is historically the worst month for stocks but this year, the calendar is a mine field for markets. From the Federal Reserve's mid-month meeting to German elections, Japanese tax changes and U.S. budget debates, there's a long list of potential catalysts for pain. Add to that the selloff in emerging markets and rising tensions in places like Egypt and Syria.The Dow, on average, has been down about one percent in September, and so far this month, it's down more than 3 percent, its worst monthly performance in more than a year. Depending how September plays out, rates could also be a problem for stocks, with some strategists expecting to see the 10-year Treasury yield touch 3 percent or even higher before the month is over. That in turn could push mortgage rates even higher. 'In August, the spring has been coiling, and in September the spring explodes,' said Marc Chandler, chief currency strategist at Brown Brothers Harriman. 'What people are kind of doing is taking positions to prepare for next month.' The first big hurdle for markets is the August employment report, on Sept. 6, a report that could dictate the Fed's decision on whether it will announce a reduction in quantitative easing. Economists are divided on when the Fed will start to pare down QE its $85 billion a month bond purchases but some believe it will be September.'People are reluctant to take big positions right now. They're more likely to lighten more risk,' Chandler said. 'Take your summer vacation because after Labor Day, it ends very quickly.'But September will also bring clarity to an issue of major concern to the markets for the past several months, and that is when exactly the Fed will begin slowing its bond purchases, something it has said it hopes to do by year end. The Fed meets Sept. 17, 18, so volatility is expected to increase around that event.'The main source of uncertainty since May has been is the Fed going to taper,' said Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank chief global strategist and head of asset allocation. 'Uncertainty should be resolved. We think they're going to do it. You're going to see some uncertainty leaving.'September markets also have history against them, with the Dow down 60 percent of the time since 1950. 'September is usually not a good month for equities so there are the seasonal issues. Given the volatility in the first half, net net September is not going to be great, but October, November and December should be good,' he said.Fed Ahead Bond yields have been moving higher ahead of the Fed's September meeting, and just as there is disagreement in the market about when the Fed will taper, there's a range of opinions on how much it will reduce its bond purchases. Fed officials have said they would like to begin cutting back on purchases before year end and complete bond buying by the middle of next year.'I suspect that we're going to grind a little bit lower from these levels into the September employment report,' said Ian Lyngen, senior Treasury strategist at CRT Capital. 'All the anecdotes suggest we'll get an at trend or slightly better-than-trend employment report. Then we'll commence the process of pricing in a tapering down, and that will push 10-year yields back to or above 3 percent. That's predicated on the fact that nonfarm payrolls are strong enough and no one can predict that number.' The 10-year yield was at 2.82 percent Friday, off its high yield of the week.Lyngen expects to see the Fed cut back $5 billion of its $40 billion in monthly mortgage purchases, and $10 billion from its Treasury purchases. Others expect the Fed to pare back as little as $10 billion in total and as much as $25 billion in the first move to cut back. 'We do think they are going to start tapering,' said Bruce Kasman, chief economist at J.P. Morgan. 'This is going to be a slow process. There's still an open question of whether they do it symmetrically, pulling down Treasury and MBS equally. We think it could be only Treasurys.' Kasman expects the Fed to cut out $15 billion to $25 billion in Treasury purchases in the first round.Kasman said the Fed will also be looking at its 2016 forecast at the September meeting, an event that in itself could bring some volatility to rates. 'We think we'll see them forecasting an economy that's close to full employment at the end of 2016,' he said.The market, however, is not forecasting normalized short-term rates by then which would be more likely 4.25 to 4.5 percent, if the economy is at full employment, said Chadha. 'The market pricing of the Fed funds rate is like 75 or 100 basis points by March, 2016, and that would be basically off by 350 basis points. That is a huge challenge. That's one of the reasons I believe there will be this volatility,' he said.Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke holds a briefing after the September Fed meeting, his second to last post-FOMC briefing before his expected retirement at year end. The market focus on his replacement has already added volatility. Traders say an appointment of former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers would mean higher rates and be a minus for stocks since he is seen as less dovish than Fed insider Vice Chair Janet Yellen.'It's one of the most ferocious fights I've seen in my career. I think people at the Fed adore Janet Yellen and they have great respect for her intellect, and they're rooting for her, but Barack Obama has been through the wars with Larry Summers and he's comfortable with Larry Summers,' said Greg Valliere, chief political strategist at Potomac Research. ' I think there will be a calculation at the White House soon that a confirmation hearing on Larry Summers would be a train wreck.'The White House is already gearing up for a battle with House Republicans on the budget this fall. 'Yellen would sail through. Does the White House want another big fight by nominating Summers and angering Democrats? I think the prospect of a really ugly conformation fight could tip the balance in favor of Yellen,' he said.Budget BattlingKasman said that September is just the beginning of an active several months, since it is likely the showdown in Congress, comes not with a budget resolution to fund the government by the end of September but with a debt ceiling debate in November. 'The odds favor an increase in the debt ceiling, but it could take a crisis mentality for that to happen,' said Valliere. 'I just think we'll come right to the precipice. There will be a lot of anxiety but at the end of the day, they'll raise the debt ceiling. The bottom line is even more fiscal restraint is coming before the end of the year. It's a headwind for the economy but not a huge one. It will keep growth a little lower than it would have been.'Valliere said Republicans do not want to get blamed for shutting down the government so he expects to see a budget compromise in September that keeps the government funded until December. This past week, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican from Ohio, said he plans to avoid a government shutdown at the end of September by passing a short-term budget bill that maintains the automatic sequester budget cuts.'Right now I've talked to an awful lot of smart people and they can't figure out how this is going to play out in December. There's a chance the debt ceiling doesn't need to be taken on until later because Treasury receipts look great,' Valliere said. It's likely there will be a continuation of the sequester, or automatic spending cuts, in the amount of $100 billion for next year, he added.'The hard-core conservatives in the House will insist upon new concessions in order for their votes to boost the debt ceiling. That could mean at least another year of sequester,' he said. 'The idea they are going to de-fund Obamacare I think the markets will look past that and look past the shutdown threat. The registration period starts October 1 and I think that it will be funded.'There will also be uncertainty surrounding the beginning of registration for coverage under Obamacare, or the Affordable Care Act. House Republicans have been unsuccessfully proposing bills to kill it. 'The registration period begins October 1, and I think it will be funded,' said Valliere.Around the GlobeThe German election Sept. 22 has been getting a lot of focus in the foreign exchange market even though a coalition backing Chancellor Angela Merkel is expected to win. 'It's not about what's happening in the German election,' said Chandler. 'What's key is that the election has led to pent up problems they don't want to address until after the German election' Greece being one of them.Greece's bailout became an issue for Merkel this past week, when her predecessor Gerhard Schroeder said at a rally of his opposition Social Democrats that the governing coalition tried to hide the fact that another Greek bailout is necessary and that 'Germany will have to pay for a Europe not as steady on its legs as we are.''People believe that when the German election is over, the German government can turn its attention to Europe in a more free way,' Kasman said. 'People are pointing to the election as a pivot point for European policy going forward.'Investors are also watching Japan, where Prime Minister Shinzo Abe has promised to decide in September on whether to raise the consumpution tax by three points to 8 percent, which could slow the economy. The increase would be the first of two that would take it to 10 percent by 2015, and the question is what other structural changes Abe's government would propose.'I think the consumption tax is going to go,' said Kasman. 'We're hopeful but not confident that we see a corporate tax cut that hopefully softens the blow by about a half.'Investors are also watching China to see if it is making a turn, after signs of improvement in manufacturing data. 'We see some signs that things are stabilizing and some signs that policy makers are doing things to stop growth from falling further,' said Kasman. But China is still a wild card, he said.

"title": "Crowdsourcing to save historic Ford Model T plant", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Source: Ford Motor Company In 1914 after Ford announced it was raising worker's pay, thousands swamped the Highland Park plant to apply for jobs. It may be one of the most important sites in automotive historythe home of the first moving assembly line and the place where workers first were offered $5-a-day wagesbut today, there are few signs to show the significance of the old Ford plant in the struggling Detroit suburb Highland Park beyond the Model T name on an adjacent shopping center. That could change if a Motor City community and economic development group has its way. The Woodward Avenue Action Association, known as WA3, is launching a new crowdsource fundraiser intended to not only save the historic factory but possibly help turn it into a tourist and learning center, which is among the options under study for the building's future. WA3's new crowdsourcing campaign is an initially modest one. The group needs $550,000 to acquire several of the remaining buildings on the property. It has already received more than $400,000 in grants and now hopes to raise another $125,000 to secure the purchase. Eventually, organizers say, they will need still more cash to begin restoration and renovation. Designed by legendary architect Albert Kahn and once known as the Crystal Palace because of its large windows and abundant natural light, the Highland Park Assembly Plant was actually the third Ford Motor factory and the second to produce the Model T. But with huge demand for his 'Tin Lizzie,' Henry Ford desperately needed to increase production. He also needed to ensure a reliable source of labor at a time when workers routinely quit because of the grueling demands of the automotive assembly line. That led the industry pioneer to begin offering $5-a-day wages. But Ford had another motive in mind. It also created a new class of increasingly affluent customers who he rightly assumed would also buy the Model T rather than taking the streetcar to work. The factory first opened in 1910 but Ford continued to struggle with booming demand for the little car. He came up with an idea reverse engineered from the slaughterhouses of the Midwest where carcasses where pushed along a conveyor, each worker hacking off a specific slice of meat. Highland Park began pulling partially assembled Model T bodies along a conveyorinitially by ropeworkers at each station assigned to complete a specific task. The move helped Ford steadily reduce production costs, dropping the price of the flivver from $800, when it was first introduced, to just $300 by the end of its run. Ford to close all manufacturing in Australia by 2016 Alan Mulally, CEO of Ford, tells CNBC that the company makes relatively few vehicles in Australia but it will continue to have a 'tremendous presence' in the country. The plant's taxes and jobs helped turn the surrounding community into one of the most affluent in the country, but despite its original breakthroughs, the multistory plant grew increasingly outdated and what was once described as 'the factory that changed the world' was largely abandoned by the late 1920s as Ford Motor opened its even more massive factory complex along Detroit's Rouge River. Some component and tractor assembly operations continued for a while but the plant has largely been abandoned, with some portions surviving as a company storage depot, and a section as a clothing warehouse. The surrounding suburb has also faded away and is now under emergency financial management. Despite being added to the National Historic Landmark registry in 1978, there have been concerns the old Model T plant could suffer the same fate as so many other once-prosperous Detroit factoriessuch as the Packard plant a few miles away that has been steadily collapsing, the prospects of saving it growing increasingly dim. The '$5 A Day' campaign has a deadline of Sept. 19 to complete the initial financing package. It could prove especially appropriate as that deadline comes just weeks before the 100th anniversary of the moving assembly line which, a statement from Ford noted, began operating on Oct. 7, 1913, 'creating and defining the industrial age.' Those who want to donate to the $5 A Day campaign can call 248-288-2004 or visit www.woodwardavenue.org. By CNBC Contributor Paul A. Eisenstein.

"content": " Tesla millionaires? Friday, 23 Aug 2013 | 2:53 PM ET CNBC's Phil LeBeau reports the latest on Tesla's safety concerns; and Patrick Hop, Berkeley student, shares why he poured his life savings into Tesla when shares were selling for $32. Patrick Hop admits that everyone told him he shouldn't do it. A year later, he's glad he ignored their warnings. The 22-year-old student at the University of California, Berkeley invested $30,000 into Tesla stock a year ago and has parlayed it into an investment worth approximately $250,000 today. 'I was always preaching to my friends, 'Tesla's gonna be huge' and my friends thought I was crazy,' said Hop. 'Now my friends are surprised this has actually worked.' Officially, Hop's gains are all on paper. But that paper keeps going up in value. On Friday, Tesla shares climbed above $160 for the first time evermeaning the stock is up more than 400 percent in the past year. What's Tesla stock doing now? Letting it ride on TSLA Hop, made in his initial investment in Tesla a year ago when the stock was trading at $32. When Tesla stock took off, Hop went along for the ride. When it soared to $115, he dumped the stock. But instead of pocketing a huge profit, he reinvested the money into Tesla call options that expire in January 2015 with a strike price of $130. 'I figure it wasn't that risky going into those options,' said Hop. 'And I'll probably dump those options in the next month or two.' When it's all said and done, it remains to be seen exactly how much of a profit Hop will make off his initial investment. Still, the college student who hopes to someday start up his own company thinks his strategy of investing heavily in one company was the right thing to do. After all, Hop considers himself a Tesla expert since he spends extensive time researching and tracking Tesla. 'I'm a big believer in their battery technology.' Elon Musk on Tesla's stock price Shares of Tesla Motors have been in overdrive, up 353 percent on the year. But could the stock be overvalued? You'll be surprised to hear what CEO Elon Musk thinks. But first, Phil Lebeau asks if the Tesla co-founder considers his company a tech-innovator or an automaker. Overvalued at $160? As Tesla shares climb to a new high, it's renewed the debate about whether or not shares of Tesla are overvalued? Or should analysts look at Tesla with the valuation of an auto company or a tech company? 'We're an automotive tech company,' Tesla CEO Elon Musk told CNBC Thursday on the automakers plant floor in Fremont, Calif. 'I'm not a fan of trying to pump the stock or trying to convince people the stock should be higher, or even convince people the stock should be where it is now. I actually think the value of Tesla right now, the market is being very generous and it's obviously giving us a lot of credit for future execution.' Investors are betting that Tesla can expand sales from a projected 21,000 this year to well over 100,000 in three to four years when the company rolls out a lower-priced third-generation car. So there's a lot of execution risk built into the bullish sentiment surrounding Tesla right now. Nobody is more aware of that risk than Musk. 'I really think the valuation we've gotten is more than we have any right to deserve honestly,' said Musk. 'We need to make sure we knock the ball out of the park in the coming years.' Betting on Tesla, banking on Musk When Hop thinks about the risks that could bring Tesla shares, and his sizable investment, crashing down, he worries about earthquakes and Musk stepping down as CEO. 'There's definitely some outlying risks with Tesla and Elon leaving is one of them,' he said. Fortunately for Hop, Musk isn't leaving Tesla anytime soon. He's committed to running the company at least through the projected ramp up in production of a third-generation car, which is at least three to four years away. 'I think I get far too much credit for the success of Tesla,' said Musk. 'The reason we've been successful is because we have a team of people who work super hard. I'm the one who talks about the results but it's not me who did it really, it's the team here who did it.' 'Teslanaires' hope Musk and his team continue doing what they're doing. As for Hop, he's yet to buy a Model S. If and when he cashes in his Tesla investment, paying for a $70,000 Model S shouldn't be a problem. 'I'll probably buy one at some point,' said Hop.

"title": "Egypt widens crackdown and meaning of Islamist", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Gianluigi Guercia | AFP | Getty Images Supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood Having crushed the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian authorities have begun cracking down on other dissenters, sometimes labeling even liberal activists or labor organizers as dangerous Islamists. Ten days ago, the police arrested two left-leaning Canadians one of them a filmmaker specializing in highly un-Islamic movies about sexual politics and implausibly announced that they were members of the Brotherhood, the conservative Islamist group backing the deposed president, Mohamed Morsi. In Suez this month, police and military forces breaking up a steelworkers strike charged that its organizers were part of a Brotherhood plot to destabilize Egypt. On Saturday, the chief prosecutor ordered an investigation into charges of spying against two prominent activists associated with the progressive April 6 group. When a journalist with a state newspaper spoke publicly about watching a colleague's wrongful killing by a soldier, prosecutors appeared to fabricate a crime to punish the journalist. And the police arrested five employees of the religious Web site Islam Today for the crime of describing the military takeover as a coup, security officials said. Egypt: is the 'counter-revolution' starting? Hosni Mubarak was flown to a military hospital, after being released from prison, where he will remain under arrest due to the state of national emergency, reports CNBC's Yousef Gamal El-Din. Police abuses and politicized prosecutions are hardly new in Egypt, and they did not stop under Mr. Morsi. But since the military takeover last month, some rights activists say, the authorities are acting with a sense of impunity exceeding even the period before the 2011 revolt against Hosni Mubarak. The government installed by Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi has renewed the Mubarak-era state of emergency removing all rights to due process or protections against police abuse. And police officials have pronounced themselves 'vindicated.' They say the new government's claim that it is battling Islamist violence corroborates what they have been saying all along: that it was Islamists, not the police, who killed protesters before Mr. Mubarak's ouster. 'What is different is that the police feel for the first time in two and a half years, for the first time since January 2011, that they have the upper hand, and they do not need to fear public accountability or questioning,' said Heba Morayef, a researcher for Human Rights Watch. In the more than seven weeks since Mr. Morsi's ouster, security forces have carried out at least three mass shootings at pro-Morsi street protests, killed more than a thousand Morsi supporters and arrested at least as many, actions Ms. Morayef characterized as 'massive police abuse on an unprecedented scale.' But even beyond the Islamists, she said, 'anyone who questions the police right now is a traitor, and that is a protection that they did not have even in 2010,' when public criticism was tolerated and at least a few complaints were investigated. Prosecutors had already begun investigating Mohamed ElBaradei, the liberal former United Nations diplomat, for 'betraying the public trust.' President Obama has said the new government is on a 'dangerous path' marked by 'arbitrary arrests, a broad crackdown on Mr. Morsi's associations and supporters' and 'violence that's taken the lives of hundreds of people and wounded thousands more.' Warning that 'our traditional cooperation cannot continue as usual when civilians are being killed in the streets and rights are being rolled back,' the president canceled a planned joint military exercise. He pledged a review of the $1.3 billion a year in military aid to Egypt, and the State Department took steps to hold back some of the roughly $200 million in nonmilitary aid. But mindful of Egypt's importance in the region, he stopped short of declaring the takeover an illegal 'coup' or cutting off the aid, instead urging an early return to democracy. Officials of the new government insist they are committed to establishing the rule of law, as soon as they overcome what they describe as the mortal threat to Egypt of violence by the Brotherhood and other Islamist supporters of Mr. Morsi. The police appear to be rounding up Brotherhood members on the basis of their affiliation, without other publicly known evidence of crimes. Mr. Morsi is being held incommunicado at an undisclosed location. But government spokesmen insist that every individual, including Mr. Morsi, will be tried by a court and released if acquitted. 'It is up to the courts,' Nabil Fahmy, the interim foreign minister, said in a recent interview. All will be handled 'in accordance with the rule of law,' he said. But some of the recent charges, like those against the two Canadians, strain credibility. Tarek Loubani, a Canadian physician with Palestinian roots and a history as a liberal and pro-Palestinian activist, was in Egypt on his way to the Gaza Strip to provide training to Palestinian doctors. John Greyson, a liberal Toronto filmmaker whose work often focuses on cosmopolitan sexual themes, was with him, documenting the trip for a possible movie. A lawyer for the two said they were stopped at a checkpoint near a street battle, trying to walk back to their hotel after the 7 p.m. curfew. 'They were just in the wrong place at very much the wrong time,' the lawyer, Khaled El-Shalakany, said Saturday. The exact circumstances of their arrest were unclear. In a public statement, Egyptian prosecutors accused them of 'participating with members of the Muslim Brotherhood' in an armed assault on a police station and 'taking part in bloody crimes of violence.' Prosecutors told reporters at the time that the police had detained 240 Brotherhood 'members,' including two Canadians. At the Suez steel plant, workers started a sit-in several weeks ago over compensation, health care and the firing of about a dozen employees. On Aug. 12, state news media reported that the Egyptian military had tried to force an end to the strike, arresting two of its leaders. 'They picked the ones with beards!' a bystander shouts in a video of the arrests. An army statement at the time used unmistakable coded language to blame the Islamists, charging that 'infiltrating elements' who were 'exploiters of religion' were trying to poison the workers' meetings 'in the name of religion.' A state-run newspaper quoted the interim labor minister, Kamal Abu Eita, saying that security forces had found Brotherhood members from another factory involved in the strike. A privately owned newspaper supporting the military takeover, Youm El Saba, quoted Mr. Eita blaming the Brotherhood for inciting strikes in several cities. Among some supporters of the new government, 'Islamist' has become a popular indictment. After Mr. Obama criticized Egypt's crackdown on the Islamists, Tahani el-Gebali, a former judge close to the military, publicly accused him of having ties to the Brotherhood, claiming his Kenyan half brother directed investments for the group. The activists with the April 6 group being investigated for spying, Asmaa Mahfouz and Esraa Abdel Fattah, were associated with the group when it was working in opposition to Mr. Mubarak. State news media reports on Saturday indicated the charges were a revival of old allegations that the group had worked on behalf of Western powers to stir unrest in Egypt. The notion was first floated by Mubarak intelligence agencies and the generals who succeeded him, no evidence has emerged to support the claims, and the group has denied the charges. More from the New York Times Other Nations Offer a Lesson to Egypt's Military Leaders 5 Days After Closing Border, Egypt Opens Crossing to Gaza Hosni Mubarak's Path From Presidency to Prison and Beyond The journalist who spoke out about his colleague's killing had been driving with the colleague, Tamer Abdel Raouf, the head of the local office of the official newspaper, Al Ahram, in the delta province of Beheira. When their car was at a checkpoint, soldiers enforcing the 7 p.m. curfew shot and killed Mr. Abdel Raouf. The authorities have granted journalists a curfew exemption, and Mr. Abdel Raouf was driving a car bearing an official press badge from a meeting with the governor. A military spokesman offered no apology, only condolences, and warned others not to try to speed through checkpoints. The next day, the journalist who had been in the passenger seat, Hamed al-Barbari, began giving television interviews contradicting the spokesman. Rather than speeding, Mr. Barbari said, his colleague was shot in the head while slowly turning his car in response to a soldier's instructions. 'A foolish act' by one soldier, said Mr. Barbari, who was injured when the car crashed. About two hours after he spoke, a prosecutor arrested Mr. Barbari in the hospital and placed him in custody for four days, for allegedly possessing an illegal shotgun in the car at the time of the episode. Prosecutors set a court date to begin investigating a citizen complaint against Mr. ElBaradei after he quit as vice president to protest the police violence against the Islamists. Last week, a prosecutor even opened an investigation into some of the young organizers behind the protests calling for the military to remove Mr. Morsi. The prosecutor was weighing a complaint of 'disturbing the public order' because they criticized the release from prison of Mr. Mubarak. Such a case would be an attack on the new government's first supporters. Prosecutors have not yet begun a full investigation of the complaint and could still set it aside. 'It is ridiculous,' said Mai Wahba, a leader of the group. "

"title": "Obama weighs up options after Syria gas attack", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Getty Images President Barack Obama and his top military and national security advisers hashed out options on Saturday for responding to the alleged use of chemical weapons in Syria amid 'increasing signs' that the government used poison gas against civilians. Obama spoke with British Prime Minister David Cameron, a top U.S. ally, and agreed that chemical weapon use by Syrian President Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces would merit a 'serious response,' a spokesperson for the prime minister said in a statement. Syrian opposition accounts that between 500 and well over 1,000 civilians were killed this week by gas in munitions fired by pro-government forces, and video footage of victims' bodies, have stoked demands abroad for a robust, U.S.-led response after 2 1/2 years of international inaction on Syria's conflict. Syria sought to avert blame by saying its soldiers had found chemical weapons in rebel tunnels. Did Syria cross red line? NBC's Steve Handelsman reports critics in Washington are complaining that President Obama's delay of any U.S. military response is giving Syria a green light to use weapons again. Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, Huffington Post; Avik Roy, Manhattan Institute; and Mark Simone, WOR radio talk show host, share their opinions on what they want President Obama to do. Obama has been reluctant to intervene in Syria's civil war, but reports of the killings near Damascus have put pressure on the White House to make good on the president's comment a year ago that chemical weapons would be a 'red line' for the United States. The United States is repositioning naval forces in the Mediterranean to give Obama the option for an armed strike. The White House declined to list what options were discussed on Saturday and said Washington was still gathering details about the attack. 'In coordination with international partners and mindful of the dozens of contemporaneous witness accounts and record of the symptoms of those killed, the U.S. intelligence community continues to gather facts to ascertain what occurred,' it said in a statement. American and European security sources have said U.S. and allied intelligence agencies made a preliminary assessment that chemical weapons were used by Syrian forces in the attack. The United Nations has requested access to the site. Obama spoke to Cameron after the White House meeting. A spokesperson for the British prime minister said the two men noted increasing signs of Syrian government culpability. \u007f'They are both gravely concerned by the attack that took place in Damascus on Wednesday and the increasing signs that this was a significant chemical weapons attack carried out by the Syrian regime against its own people,' the spokesperson said. 'The fact that President Assad has failed to cooperate with the U.N. suggests that the regime has something to hide.' Cameron also spoke to Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Harper spoke to French President Franois Hollande. Syria rejects blame Obama said in a CNN interview broadcast on Friday that chemical weapon use on a large scale would start 'getting to some core national interests that the United States has, both in terms of us making sure that weapons of mass destruction are not proliferating, as well as needing to protect our allies, our bases in the region.' But Americans strongly oppose U.S. intervention in Syria's civil war and believe Washington should stay out of the conflict even if reports that Syria's government used deadly chemicals to attack civilians are confirmed, according to a new Reuters/Ipsos poll. Syrian state television said soldiers found chemical materials on Saturday in tunnels that had been used by rebels, rejecting the blame for carrying out a nerve gas attack. The state news agency, SANA, said soldiers had 'suffered from cases of suffocation' when rebels used poison gas 'as a last resort' after government forces made 'big gains' against them in the Damascus suburb of Jobar. The leader of the opposition Syrian National Coalition, Ahmad al-Jarba, and the head of the rebel Free Syrian Army, General Salim Idriss, denied on Saturday that rebels had used chemical weapons. Jabra said the 'most important cause' of the attack was the silence and inaction of the international community, especially the West. Andrew Tabler, a Syria expert at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there was growing consensus in the West that Assad's government was responsible. 'It's very clear, I think, that the U.S. and the Western governments think that the regime did it,' he said. 'Whether their response would immediately be military or not, I don't know. I suspect that first they're probably going to push for diplomacy, but probably with a pretty short fuse.' In the most authoritative account so far, the medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres said three hospitals near Damascus had reported 355 deaths in the space of three hours out of about 3,600 admissions with nerve gas-type symptoms. A senior U.N. official arrived in Damascus to seek access for inspectors to the site of last Wednesday's attack. Major world powers - including Russia, Assad's main ally which has long blocked U.N.-sponsored intervention against him - have urged the Syrian leader to cooperate with U.N. chemical weapons inspectors already in Damascus to pursue earlier allegations. But Russia said the rebels were impeding an inquiry and that Assad would have no interest in using poison gas for fear of foreign intervention. Alexei Pushkov, pro-Kremlin chairman of the international affairs committee in Russia's lower house of parliament, said: 'In London, they are 'convinced' that Assad used chemical weapons, and earlier they were 'convinced' that there were weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. It's the same old story.' What's the end game for Syria? Richard Mallinson, chief policy analyst at Energy Aspects, tells CNBC that a confirmation of chemical weapons in Syria would put a lot of pressure on Obama. 'Range of Options' The list of participants in the White House meeting underscored its importance. They included Vice President Joe Biden, national security adviser Susan Rice, CIA Director John Brennan, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Martin Dempsey, and Samantha Power, the U.S. representative to the United Nations. Aides said Secretary of State John Kerry, who is on vacation in Massachusetts, and Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel, who is traveling in Asia, both participated remotely. Administration officials were cautious in describing the content of the discussions and warned against expectations of a decision on Saturday. 'We have a range of options available, and we are going to act very deliberately so that we're making decisions consistent with our national interest as well as our assessment of what can advance our objectives in Syria,' a White House official said before the meeting. 'Once we ascertain the facts, the president will make an informed decision about how to respond,' a White House official said. Hagel said on Friday the Pentagon was taking measures to prepare for all options. 'And that requires positioning our forces, positioning our assets, to be able to carry out different options - whatever options the president might choose,' he said without elaborating. A defense official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S. Navy would expand its presence in the Mediterranean to four destroyers from three. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani weighed in on the issue for the first time, saying chemical weapons had killed people in Syria, its ally. Although Rouhani stopped short of saying who he thought had used the weapons, Iran's Foreign Ministry said evidence pointed to rebels fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. The U.S. Central Command and the Jordanian armed forces were planning to host a meeting of regional defense chiefs from Sunday to Tuesday in Jordan. The group will discuss 'the region's dynamic security environment.' The meeting was scheduled in June and not called in response to the recent attacks in Syria, a Pentagon spokesman said. "

"content": " DUBLIN---- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the 'Global Voice over Mobile Broadband Market 2012-2016' report to their offering. Voice over Mobile Broadband, or VoMBB, has been recently gaining traction in the Global Telecom industry and is unanimously expected to generate huge revenue for telecom network operators in the coming years. Conceptually, VoMBB is about encompassing carrier-grade voice calls over LTE, Wi-Fi and HSPA/HSPA+ networks. While Wi-Fi is a nifty feature of the network that offloads voice and data traffic of indoor users, its prominence will reduce with the increased adoption of VoHSPA and VoLTE. VoHSPA and VoLTE are expected to gain ground as they will enable high spectrum efficiency, reduce cost per subscriber, and provide richer voice and therefore, will dramatically alter the operations of telecom operators. Given the increasing demand for bandwidth capacity, refarming legacy network spectrum will be one of the trends that will be emerging in the market. However, delay in setting-up LTE ecosystems could hinder the growth of this market. The report includes the following compatible user device vendors in the market: Apple Inc., Acer Inc., AETA Audio Systems, Alcatel-TCL, Research in Motion Ltd., Glensound Electronics Ltd., Gigabyte Technology Co.

"title": "Microsoft CEO Ballmer to step down within 12 months", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Getty Images Steve Ballmer, Chief Executive Officer of Microsoft Microsoft's CEO Steve Ballmer shocked the technology world on Friday by announcing he would step down within 12 months, punctuating a tenure marked by the software giant's declining dominance and struggles to keep pace with its competitors. In a statement, Microsoft said Ballmer would retire 'upon the completion of a process to choose his successor. In the meantime, Ballmer will continue as CEO and will lead Microsoft through the next steps of its transformation to a devices and services company that empowers people for the activities they value most.' Market scrutiny will now likely shift to who will be tapped to succeed Ballmer. Despite that uncertainty, investors applauded the news by sending Microsoft's shares surging by more than 7 percent adding a whopping $24 billion to the software company's market capitalization from Thursday's close. Microsoft's Ballmer to retire in 12 months Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer will retire in 12 months, and the company will consider both internal and external candidates, reports CNBC's Jon Fortt. The announcement took markets by surprise, and came only a month after the Redmond-based technology behemoth announced a broad reorganization designed to capitalize on the relentless shift toward mobile technology. Ballmer acknowledged the strategic shift, as he complemented the new leadership team. 'There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,' Ballmer said in a statement. 'My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our company's transformation to a devices and services company,' he added. 'We need a CEO who will be here longer term for this new direction.'A 33-year veteran of the software giant, Ballmer once oversaw Microsoft's sales and operations, and played an instrumental role in birthing the X-box, one of the company's most successful product lines.Still, Microsoft's traditional strengths in office software hit rough shoals, mirroring the dramatic slump in personal computer sales. In recent years, its suite of Windows and Microsoft Office products have taken a back seat to mobile applications that provide users with both entertainment and productivity. Sales of its Surface tablets have been comparatively meager, and the company was forced to shave the device's price in order to boost lagging sales. Ballmer succeeded billionaire Bill Gates in 2000, the iconic wunderkind whose knack for technology innovation was rivaled only by deceased Apple CEO Steve Jobs. Much like Apple's current CEO Tim Cook, Ballmer was forced to wrestle with unfavorable comparisons to his predecessor, despite a much more flamboyant personal style that made for several viral videos. Under Ballmer's leadership, Microsoft's stock languished and its rivals most of whom moved rapidly to profit from the explosive growth of smartphones and tablets began separating themselves from the rest of the technology pack. Balmer's ascension to the top suite at Microsoft coincided with the bursting of the Dotcom bubble. As a result, he presided over a 37 percent decline in the company's stock price, relegating Microsoft to among the worst performing stocks in the Nasdaq 100 Index. Ironically, Gates himself will have a hand in selecting Ballmer's successor. Microsoft said that its board would appoint a special committee to find a new chief, which will include Gates, audit committee chair Chuck Noski and compensation chairman Steve Luczo. The group 'will consider both external and internal candidates.' "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " * Ballmer to retire in next 12 months* Special committee to find new CEO, no obvious candidate* Activist shareholder recently campaigned for change* Ballmer long criticized by Wall StreetSEATTLE/NEW YORK, Aug 23 - Steve Ballmer, a passionate salesman who has been a central figure at Microsoft Corp for more than three decades, unexpectedly announced his retirement as chief executive on Friday, ending a controversial 13-year reign in which the world's largest software company lost its position as the dominant force in computing. The surprise move sent the company's share price up 7 percent, reflecting a widespread view that Ballmer is not the man to reverse the fortunes of a company that remains highly profitable but has failed to navigate the transition to the mobile computing era. Ballmer's planned exit comes just weeks after the company announced a major reorganization and delivered an earnings report that showed across-the-board weakness in the business, including dismal sales of the company's new Surface tablet and a lukewarm reaction to the crucial Windows 8 operating system.Microsoft said it had engaged the executive search firm Heidrick & Struggles and would consider both internal and external candidates to succeed Ballmer - underscoring the lack of a succession plan at a company where many talented executives have been squeezed out over the years. Ballmer will stay on for up to a year until a new CEO is found. A close friend and confidant of co-founder Bill Gates since the company's earliest days, the 57-year-old Ballmer formally notified the company two days ago of his intention to retire, according to a regulatory filing. In an interview with the trade publication ZD Net, director John Thompson said the search for a successor had in fact been underway for some time. 'We are well down the path in the search,' said Thomson, who is leading a search committee that also includes Gates. Still, the timing of the announcement and the lack of a succession plan suggest the recent setbacks may have spurred the company's board to act. Gates remains chairman of the board, which has historically followed his lead. Ballmer himself acknowledged his decision was abrupt. 'There is never a perfect time for this type of transition, but now is the right time,' he wrote in a memo to employees. 'This is an emotional and difficult thing for me to do. I take this step in the best interests of the company I love.' Ballmer has faced criticism from investors for years as rivals led by Apple Inc and Google Inc came to dominate huge new markets in smartphones, tablets, Internet search and cloud computing even as Microsoft remained reliant on the traditional personal computer. Activist investing fund ValueAct Capital Management LP said in April that it had taken a stake in the company and shortly after began agitating for a change in strategy and a clear CEO succession plan. Microsoft, like Apple, has been under pressure from shareholders to hand back more of its cash hoard, which now totals $77 billion. 'This might accelerate more shareholder-friendly capital returns of that cash treasure trove, which would help in the revaluation of the stock to more appropriate levels,' said Todd Lowenstein at fund firm HighMark Capital Management, which holds Microsoft shares. There are no obvious candidates to succeed Ballmer at a company that has only had two CEOs in its 38-year history. Ballmer had once indicated that he intended to stay at least until 2017.Ballmer can claim some important successes: revenue tripled during his tenure, profits doubled, and the company scored a big success with the Xbox videogame business. The Windows and Office franchises remain highly profitable, and Microsoft is well-entrenched as a vendor of corporate computing products and services. At the same time, though, repeated forays into mobile phones, tablets and music players have come to grief. The Surface tablet, aimed at the hugely successful iPad, alienated longtime hardware partners even as it failed to generate significant sales, and a phone partnership with Nokia has thus far yielded little for either company. At the same time, the company has lost billions trying to compete with Google in the Internet search business. Some of Microsoft's corporate computing businesses are also under threat from the industry-wide transition to cloud-based services. The recent reorganization was aimed at reshaping Microsoft - once primarily a purveyor of packaged software - into a company focused on devices and services, essentially mimicking Apple. Yet most industry watchers felt it was too little, too late, with some calling on the company to back away from the consumer products sector and focus on serving businesses. In the ZD Net interview, Ballmer rejected that approach. 'Nobody has ever managed to figure out how to build a device for a user that was just enterprise or just consumer,' he said. 'These core experiences do span 'consumer and enterprise.''PASSION AT THE TOP Ballmer, a forceful, often emotional leader, was regarded a great salesman rather than a brilliant technologist. A physically imposing presence with a booming voice, his motivational efforts were the stuff of legend: a clip of a semi-hysterical Ballmer screeching and dancing around the stage to rally Microsoft employees has been viewed nearly five million times on YouTube. Yet the antics sometimes acquired an air of desperation as Apple and other rivals produced industry-changing innovations that Microsoft couldn't match. 'That is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business customers,' Ballmer laughed in a TV interview after the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007. Five years later, iPhone sales alone were greater than Microsoft's overall revenue. A Michigan native, Ballmer studied applied mathematics and economics at Harvard, where he met Gates. Several years later Gates persuaded him to drop out of Stanford Business School to become Microsoft's first commercial manager and the company's 30th employee. To induce him, Gates offered Ballmer part ownership of the company, and when Microsoft incorporated a year later, Ballmer had almost an 8 percent stake. That formed the foundation of his wealth which is now valued at $15 billion by Forbes magazine. Ballmer remains one of the largest holders of Microsoft stock, with about four percent of the company. His net worth, ironically, soared by nearly a billion dollars on Friday as the stock market celebrated his departure. Microsoft shares closed up 7.3 percent at $34.75 on Nasdaq on Friday. "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Why Steve Ballmer gets a B-plus as CEO Friday, 23 Aug 2013 | 12:28 PM ET Over his tenure at the helm of Microsoft, Steve Ballmer tripled revenues and returned almost $200 billion to shareholders, Yale School of Management's Jeffrey Sonnenfeld says. The candidates outside Microsoft to succeed outgoing CEO Steve Ballmer are impressive, management expert Jeffrey Sonnenfeld said Friday. His top pick is T-Mobile CEO John Legere. Legere, a former executive at Dell and AT&T, is experiencing 'incredible performance,' Sonnenfeld said on CNBC's 'Fast Money.' 'John Legere knows every part of this business. His ad rates are soaring. At T-Mobile, the usage is up dramatically,' he said. 'And he actually really knows the device business. His relationships with Apple, Samsung and everybody out there is spectacular.' Two other possibilities were Yahoo's CEO and Facebook's COO. 'Marissa Mayer should be on everybody's short list. It's incredible what's happening at Yahoo,' he said. 'And, of course, Sheryl Sandberg is certainly dressed up and ready to go as CEO somewhere, too. So, there's ample, fantastic talent on the outside.' Ballmer, who succeeded Bill Gates to take the helm of Microsoft in 2000, announced that he would be leaving the company within the next 12 months. For his performance, Ballmer eared a 'B-minus' grade from Sonnenfeld, who is senior associate dean for Executive Programs at the Yale University School of Management. 'Over that 11 years, he's actually tripled revenues,' he said. 'It's a $76 billion business. It was a third of that when he stepped in.' During Ballmer's tenure, Microsoft returned close to $200 billion to shareholders. 'Nobody else has given shareholders that much back in dividends and repurchases,' Sonnenfeld said. 'That's a pretty good record.' Step into the Gap Gap recorded its sixth consecutive quarter of higher same-store sales. Will Gap be the next to fall victim to the teen slump? Stephanie Link and Mike Murphy debate. Joe Saluzzi, Themis Trading, joins to discuss Nasdaq's 'flash freeze.' And according to Dow Jones quoting sources, Bats Global Markets is in merger talks with Direct Edge. Sonnenfeld also praised Microsoft for evolving into new areas. 'They have 75 percent of their revenues now are not coming from those old operating systems,' he said. 'They've been moving into these new business categories.' Even thoughas TheStreet CIO Stephanie Link noted earlierMicrosoft stock is 39 percent lower since Ballmer took over, Sonnenfeld said that share prices weren't everything. 'Let's think of those new-new thing companies,' he said. 'The companies that were being celebrated then for their soaring stock performance were, you know, GeoCities and Excite and Lycos and Kozmo and WebVan and HomeGrocer and Netscape, Snap, Lycos, eToys. 'What's happened to those? They were soaring stock and then they disappeared. This is a company that's built for sustainability, not to be the new-new thing.' Sonnenfeld said that there was 'a dependability' and 'a reliability' with Microsoft's moves. But why now? 'The why now issue, I think, has to do with why would this not been about six, seven weeks ago,' he said. 'If there was great board disaffection, you would not have let him go through this massive restructuring. What he's done now is the heavy lifting for a successor. He said he wasn't going to see it through, sort of like Moses saying, 'I'm not going to get you to the Promised Land.'' By CNBC's Bruno J. Navarro. Follow him on Twitter @Bruno_J_Navarro.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Stocks advanced on Friday as a sharp drop in new home sales added to the uncertainty about when the Federal Reserve may begin to reduce its monthly bond purchases. Microsoft shares surged, giving the tech sector a boost, after the company said CEO Steve Ballmer will retire within 12 months. Facebook, meanwhile, climbed 5 percent to close above $40. Name Price Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed, helped by a 7 percent surge in Microsoft and 1 percent gains in Verizon and AT&T shares. Travelers and Cisco were among the laggards. The S&P 500 and the Nasdaq also posted gains. The CBOE Volatility Index , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, fell to near 14. Among S&P sectors, telcos and materials paced the advance while financials and consumer discretionary underperformed. For the week the Dow fell 0.5 percent, the S&P gained 0.5 percent and the Nasdaq added 1.5 percent. As markets try to position for the September Fed meeting and some other events expected this fall, Rosenblatt Securities' Gordon Charlop said there could be a little more downside. 'I'm not seeing the same kind of aggressiveness from buyers' looking to get in on the dips, he said. And that could mean markets continue this sideways trend. A day after the 3-hour Nasdaq trading halt, Nasdaq OMX Group CEO Robert Greifeld told CNBC that the exchange has fixed the technical issues, but could not guarantee there would be no future problems. To September taper or not to taper? Vincent Reinhart, Morgan Stanley, provides insight on why the Fed is likely to begin reducing its asset-buying program next month, unless weak employment data are reported, which is not in the forecast. Focus on Jackson Hole Markets still have no greater clarity on when the Federal Reserve may begin to curtail its $85 billion in monthly bond purchases following Friday's economic data. Sales of new single-family homes fell 13.4 percent to a 394,000 annual rate in July, their lowest level in nine months. 'We've had a strong run in housing like we've had in the stock market and some correction was inevitable in the face of the spike in mortgage rates,' Dan Greenhaus of BTIG said. Home builder stocks slumped after the data. On Thursday, global manufacturing data painted a more encouraging picture of the world economy. With the data mixed, Fed officials speaking with CNBC from the annual central bank conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo. also offered few clues as to what the Fed may do at its September meeting. James Bullard of the St. Louis Fed, meanwhile, told CNBC the central bank should take its time. 'Inflation is running low, you've got mixed data on the economy, so I'd be cautious and I wouldn't want to pre-judge the meeting,' he said. Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart and San Francisco Fed president John Williams told CNBC that the Fed's actions will depend on the incoming economic data. 'Any tapering I think we would do would be in gradual steps over time,' Williams said. Ballmer retirement sends MSFT shares soaring Dan Niles, AlphaOne Capital Partners, discusses the jump in Microsoft shares after the announcement CEO Steve Ballmer will retire next year. Niles explains why he is buying some shares now as a short-term play. And CNBC's Jon Fortt shares his thoughts on the timing of Ballmer's departure. Retail earnings mixed Turning to earnings reports, Pandora Media shares tumbled after the company warned that earnings for fiscal 2014 would fall below analyst estimates as expenses to buy music rights and expand its sales personnel rise. Retailers were also in focus again with Gap, Ann, Foot Locker and Aeropostale providing a mixed picture of the American consumer. In financials, Moody's Investors Service warned it might cut the credit ratings of the six biggest U.S. banks including Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo saying the government may be unlikely to bail them out should they face trouble in the future.

"title": "'Flash Freeze' puts a new twist in tech IPO battle", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Twitter's path to IPO? Friday, 23 Aug 2013 | 1:22 PM ET Since Facebook's IPO in 2012, the Nasdaq has taken 15 tech companies public, reports CNBC's Julia Boorstin. All eyes are on Twitter, Box and Dropbox as the next anticipated IPOs. One major question after the latest snafu at Nasdaq is how it will affect the exchange's fight for hot initial public offerings. The best analogy is the Facebook IPO debacle, after which the Nasdaq lost ground to the NYSE when it came to wooing IPOs. Since that IPO, in May 2012, the Nasdaq has taken 15 tech companies public, raising $1.35 billion. In the same period, the NYSE handled 21 tech IPOs, which raised $3.5 billion, or more than twice that of its rival, according to S&P Capital IQ. 'Any exchange that prides itself on being a technology or technological vanguard, if they have hiccupshow well are they serving clients and potential clients in the future?' asked Rich Peterson, director of global markets intelligence at S&P Capital IQ. William Preston of IPO research firm Renaissance Capital told CNBC that the NYSE was already gaining share before the Facebook offering. 'Nasdaq fumbled one of the highest-profile IPOs ever, and it was so damaging to market sentiment and to CEOs of prospective IPOs that it essentially gave NYSE ammunition for future pitches,' Preston said. 'Today's trading halt will likely do the same.' The NYSE reported that its IPO lead has been accelerating, noting that in the first half of this year it raised four times as much capital from U.S. IPOs as from any other U.S. marketplace, with a record 64 percent of tech offeringsraising 58 percent of capital in the tech sector. Some of the tech companies choosing the NYSE since Nasdaq bungled Facebook's debut: Trulia, Palo Alto Networks, Workday and Evertec. The last two raised more than $500 million each. Now all eyes are on the next wave of highly anticipated offerings, expected in the next year. Twitter, storage companies Box and Dropbox, big data cruncher Palantir Technologies, and car service Uber are all expected to file $1 billion-plus IPOs. But will they head for the Nasdaq to join giants Google, Apple and Facebook, or will that exchange's blunders send them to the NYSE. 'Nasdaq was the home and the haven for many tech offerings,' said S&P's Peterson. 'But now, if you look at the post-Facebook period, the NYSE is gaining the bragging rights over its uptown competitor.' On CNBC's 'Squawk Box,' Andrew Ross Sorkin asked Nasdaq CEO Bob Greifeld how he thinks the trading freeze will impact Nasdaq's IPO business. 'I think people respect that we did handle this process in a proper way,' Greifeld said. 'We want to get to perfection; we want to get to 100 percent reliability, and we are getting better at that all the time.' 'The instances of [trading] problems in the U.S. has actually gone down,' he said. 'You can't quite get that from the press. The world is getting better. I think people recognize that.' We'll see if CEOs recognize that when they pick an exchange for their IPO. By CNBC's Julia Boorstin. Follow her on Twitter: @JBoorstin "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Aug 23 - Apple Inc and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd do not have to make public the financial details submitted to a U.S. court during high-profile patent litigation, a federal appeals panel ruled on Friday.The Federal U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Washington reversed a lower court ruling that ordered the two companies to disclose portions of documents that contain profit and sales information.'We recognize the importance of protecting the public's interest in judicial proceedings and of facilitating its understanding of those proceedings,' the three-judge appeals panel decided. 'That interest, however, does not extend to mere curiosity about the parties' confidential information where that information is not central to a decision on the merits.'Representatives for Apple and Samsung declined to comment.Peter Scheer, executive director of the First Amendment Coalition - an advocacy group that argued in the appeals court to have the information disclosed - said he was disappointed in the outcome for the Apple/Samsung case.However, Scheer said the ruling is not all bad for public access to court records. For instance, the ruling says companies cannot keep information secret in court merely by calling it a trade secret, and judges must scrutinize those secrecy requests, Scheer said.'If all the cases that come after this one adhere loosely to the legal requirements articulated in this decision,' Scheer said, 'then those trials will be infinitely more open and transparent than otherwise would have been the case.'Apple and Samsung have been waging patent litigation across the globe since 2011, climaxing in a high-profile trial last year in San Jose, California. A jury awarded Apple over $1 billion, but U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh later slashed the award and ordered a retrial on some of the damages.In the run-up to trial last year, attorneys for both sides submitted several documents to the court that contained financial details in order to calculate damages. The details were redacted, and Reuters filed motions in the court to unseal the documents.Koh ruled against Apple and Samsung, saying the public's interest in understanding the proceedings outweighed the companies' rights to keep the information secret. However, the appeals court unanimously disagreed.'While protecting the public's interest in access to the courts, we must remain mindful of the parties' right to access those same courts upon terms which will not unduly harm their competitive interest,' Judge Sharon Prost wrote.The case in the Federal Circuit is Apple Inc vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al., 12-1600.

"title": "Microsoft, Motorola set for second round of trial over patents", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " SEATTLE, Aug 25 - Microsoft Corp takes on Google's Motorola Mobility unit this week in the second of two landmark trials between the companies that delve into hot disputes over the patents behind smartphone and Internet technology.The jury trial, starting Monday in federal court in Seattle, is set to resolve whether Motorola breached its contract with Microsoft to license on reasonable terms its so-called standard essential patents, covering wireless and video technology used in the Xbox game console.The proceeding comes days after Microsoft Chief Executive Steve Ballmer unexpectedly announced his retirement. It also follows a complex trial last November that decided what the appropriate fee for Microsoft's use of Motorola-patented technology should be.After five months of deliberation, U.S. District Judge James Robart came down heavily in Microsoft's favor, saying it owed only a fraction of the royalties Motorola had claimed, suggesting the appropriate rate was about $1.8 million, above Microsoft's estimate of $1 million, but well below Motorola's demand for as much as $4 billion a year.Motorola cannot appeal Robart's April ruling until after the jury decides the second phase of the case.In a court filing, Microsoft said it had offered to pay Motorola $6.8 million in past royalties, based on its application of Robart's order. However, Motorola rejected the money, the filing said.In the forthcoming trial, starting with jury selection on Monday, Microsoft will argue that Motorola's initial demand was exorbitant and a clear breach of its agreement to charge reasonable and non-discriminatory terms - commonly referred to as 'RAND' - for technology that is an industry standard.Microsoft and Google declined comment on the trial.After the result of the first trial, Motorola may have an uphill task in persuading a jury that it did not breach its contract. But Microsoft might not be able to recover huge damages, either.'I think the interesting question is, assuming the court finds that Motorola breached its obligation to offer a RAND license, what is the remedy?' said Mark Lemley, a Stanford Law School professor who has been following the litigation. 'No court has addressed that issue before.'In its quest for damages, Microsoft will introduce evidence about how much it had to spend to relocate a facility in Germany as a result of an injunction that Motorola won in Europe, according to court filings. Robart later ordered Motorola not to enforce that injunction, and Microsoft claims it should be reimbursed.Microsoft will also seek legal fees resulting from the injunction fight.The argument between Microsoft and Motorola - and by extension Google, which now owns it - is just one facet of a wide-ranging global patent war surrounding smartphone and Internet technology that has drawn in Apple Inc, Samsung Electronics Co, Nokia and others.At heart, the companies are arguing over who owns the technology and design features behind smartphones, which are now essentially small computers.More particularly, Microsoft has been locked in a battle with Google to ensure that handset makers using Google's free Android phone operating system pay Microsoft a license fee. Most large handset makers, such as Samsung, LG and HTC , have agreed to pay Microsoft a royalty on Android handsets that Microsoft believes may infringe on its patents. Motorola, which was bought by Google last year for $12.5 billion, is the last big holdout.Robart gave each side 16 hours of trial time to present their case to a jury.The case in U.S. District Court, Western District of Washington is Microsoft Corp. vs. Motorola Inc., 10-cv-1823.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " NEW YORK, Aug 23 - The vague 'connectivity issue' that Nasdaq said triggered the outage that paralyzed a large part of the U.S. stock market on Thursday originated as a problem between Nasdaq and rival NYSE Arca, a source familiar with the matter said Friday.Nasdaq said the problem started shortly before midday Thursday and quickly cascaded through its Securities Information Processor, or SIP, the system that receives all traffic on quotes and orders for stocks on the exchange, preventing it from disseminating quotes.The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said brief outages between exchanges occur from time to time but are short-lived.In such instances, traders receive alerts from an exchange that essentially tell them to rout their order flow elsewhere for a period. Most of these episodes, which may occur several times a week, are resolved quickly.Nasdaq did not respond to requests for additional information beyond a statement issued to traders on Friday. A spokesman for NYSE Euronext, the parent of the New York Stock Exchange and its NYSE Arca platform, denied Arca was involved.Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld, in television interviews on Friday, declined to identify the source of the connectivity problem.The precise nature of the breakdown remains unclear.But the outage, first flagged at 11:48 a.m. EDT , quickly spiraled out of control and soon left $5.9 trillion of U.S. equities - more than a third of the U.S. stock market - idle for more than three hours. Shares of three of the five largest companies by market value, Apple Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp, typically also among the most active in any session, were unavailable.COMMUNICATION CRITICIZEDA number of market participants and others criticized Nasdaq's lack of an early public statement on the outage. Nasdaq did not issue a formal press release until late Thursday afternoon, well after the trading day had ended.'As usual the communication could have been a little bit better. They could improve the communication and the amount of communication,' said Mark Turner, managing director and head of sales trading at Instinet in New York.Nasdaq CEO Greifeld said the exchange sent messages through its trader alert system and was involved in direct communication with clients.Nasdaq's first responsibility was to assure 'fair and orderly markets,' Greifeld said on Friday on Fox Business Network, and exchange officials worked first to understand and fix the problem and then to communicate with the securities industry to ensure a smooth restart.'There was active communication going on,' Greifeld said.'It has shown how horrible the crisis management side is. Communication was horrid. There is no backup. So we have to focus on the crisis management side,' Mohamed El-Erian, chief executive and co-chief investment officer of Pimco, said Friday on CNBC.In the end, even those who criticized Nasdaq for the pace of its communications, agreed the reopening of trading did go well.Trading on Friday transpired with no apparent hiccups. Shares of Nasdaq itself, which fell 3.4 percent once trading resumed on Thursday, gained about 1.2 percent.IN THE EYE OF REGULATORSWhile worst-case outcomes may have been averted, the outage still was among the most serious in a series of recent technological failures to hit the U.S. securities business, including a software issue at the Chicago Board Options Exchange this spring that delayed the start of trading there for half a day.It was also the latest black eye for Nasdaq, which in May agreed to pay $10 million, the largest penalty ever against a stock exchange, to settle U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission civil charges over its mishandling of Facebook's initial public offering in 2012.The incident has already drawn the attention of regulators, and Securities and Exchange Commission Chairwoman Mary Jo White said Thursday she would like to press ahead with new market structure regulations that Nasdaq and other exchanges have resisted.White's predecessor, Mary Schapiro, said Thursday's events are a harsh reminder of the shaky nature of modern markets.'Events like this contribute to investors' concerns about the stability and integrity of the marketplace,' Schapiro told Reuters in an interview on Friday. 'I have said many times while I was SEC chairman ... investors understand they can make or lose money when they buy a stock and the fortunes of the company change. What they don't understand and shouldn't have to understand, and shouldn't be subject to, are losses based on whether the market structure is stable.'Many market participants said it was fortunate the outage occurred during a low-volume summer day.'We were lucky yesterday,' said Sal Arnuk, partner and co-founder of Themis Trading. 'If the SIP failure occurred on a 10 billion share day or any high VIX, high volume day in October - where say the Fed changes policy, then I seriously doubt they, or any exchange, would have been able to re-open 2,000-plus stocks. That is a statement to the fact that we have created and allowed and encouraged an overly complex market structure.' "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Getting to the core of Apple Friday, 16 Aug 2013 | 10:12 AM ET The movie 'Jobs' opens in theaters today. John Sculley, former Apple CEO, weighs in on its debut and Carl Icahn's involvement in the company. Former Apple CEO John Sculley says Steve Jobs, unlike Tim Cook, probably would not have taken Carl Icahn's call. Icahn spoke by phone this week with Cook, and then announced he had taken a large position in the tech company, which has been in the doldrums. Sculley, who was Apple's chief from 1983 until 1993, told CNBC's 'Squawk on the Street' that he thinks Icahn's purchase was to take advantage of an undervalued stock rather than as a long-term investment. 'I doubt if Steve Jobs would have taken Carl Icahn's call or anyone else who is an activist. I think it's a lot about financial engineering,' he said. 'The bigger story for Apple is always going to be growth and it's going to be about creative leaps in products. It's been dark for a while without any big creative leap, and I think there's a lot of expectation that there are some big things coming.' On Apple's products, Sculley suggested that the company's next leap would be wearable technology, such as the much-discussed smart watch, which could allow consumers to make purchases with their credit card through the device. 'I think Apple has been given a bad rap for a while,' Sculley said. 'It's a stock that is ready to show some growth if Tim Cook is able to deliver on the products which he has set expectations for and I am pretty optimistic.' Sculley said he saw the recently released biopic 'Jobs' on Thursday night. He said it was 'very loose on the facts' because of a 'not really fair' portrayal of Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak. However, he said that Ashton Kutcher effectively channeled Jobs' personality. Sculley said the film helps to clear up a particular 'misunderstood fact.' Many believe that he fired Jobs, and 'the movie shows that I never actually did,' he said. By CNBC's Paul Toscano.

"content": " What should you do now? Friday, 16 Aug 2013 | 1:01 PM ET Dissecting this week's market action and the latest economic data with Gregg Fisher of Gerstein Fisher and Matt Litfin of William Blair, who said, 'The market needs to enter the tapering period and find out that it will be OK.' As the Dow, Nasdaq and S&P head for a second straight week of losses for just the fourth time this year, two top-rated fund managers have weighed in with some longer-term advice. Gregg Fisher, manager of the Gerstein Fisher Multi-Factor Growth Equity Fund, and Matt Litfin of the William Blair Small Mid-Cap Growth Fund are rated five-star money managers by research firm Morningstar. U.S. stocks are no longer the only game in town, Fisher said. 'Now is a good time to take a look at where you are strategically and trim down U.S. exposure and add exposure to foreign markets, bonds and other asset classes,' he said during CNBC's 'Power Lunch' on Friday. It's a 'good time to rebalance your portfolio,' he added. Litfin is more sold on sticking with U.S. stocksfor now at leastand said, 'When you step back and look at the U.S. market, it does look pretty attractive to us. Inflation remains lowthat's especially true in food and energy.' The models at William Blair show consumer discretionary stocks are stretched, but Litfin said he likes Under Armoureven with the stock up 16 percent over the past month and 43 percent so far this year. Though it won't overtake Nike anytime soon, he said, he thinks the space is big enough for both companies. Litfin is also bullish on financial stocks, especially CBOE Holdings, which he called a 'very strong, durable business franchise.' CBOE is up 62 percent this year. Getty Images Litfin also sees an improving budget picture in the U.S., although still far from ideal. But the shrinking deficit is a good sign, he said, especially for long-term investors. In the short term, he said ' tapering is coming,' referring to an easing of the Fed's bond-buying program. Litfin said that could mean a drop in U.S. stocks. Once the Fed pares back the program, the market will get used to itmuch like children get used to bathing. 'You beg them to take a bath,' he said. 'They don't want to. They finally get in and play for half an hour and you can't get them out. The market needs to enter the tapering period, see what it's like, look around and realize we're OK.' The prospect of tapering makes Gregg Fisher of Gerstein Fisher more wary of U.S. stocks. 'Tapering, interest rates and inflation, these are big issues,' he said. 'We're looking for assets without exposure to leverage.' Fisher's top holdings are Apple, IBM and Google, with technology making up 23 percent of his portfolio. His fund is up 19.5 percent this year. Litfin is up 26 percent year to date, with almost a third of his fund invested in industrials. By CNBC's Jason Gewirtz "

"title": "Yoshikami: Paulson sold gold? So what!", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Getty Images After months of reading headlines that John Paulson's perspective on gold had not changed, we suddenly read that he had cut his holdings significantly. Just three months ago, he was quoted as saying that his thesis remains intact, but then we find that Paulson tactically adjusted his portfolios and reduced his gold position. What gives? While one might be tempted to conjure up scenarios where words do not match actions, we think it's more a function of examining current conditions and making a new decision. And that is the risk associated with reading headlines and making investment decisions based on the latest comments from anyone: Those opinions can change, and they often do. The market is quite irrational. Gold has become the flag bearer for an environment with less predictability. Gold used to be a fairly predictable trade against inflation and volatility. Now gold trades based on Federal Reserve comments, interest rates, fear, hedge fund liquidity needs, etc. Closing Bell Exchange The Dow is down over 200 points on Fed uncertainty and disappointing earnings. Michael Yoshikami of Destination Wealth Management, Keith Fitz-Gerald of Money Map Press, Frank Fantozzi of Planned Financial Services and CNBC's Bob Pisani and Rick Santelli join to discuss the market selloff. It's quite a puzzle to figure out and one we as an asset manager have decided not to attempt to decipher. In many ways it's no different than the sentiment-based trading around Apple. The company still has over $100 billion cash in the bank; the stock in the last 12 months has gone from $700 to $390 to $500, and nothing really has changed on a fundamental basis. This position is trading based on expectations and sentiment, and we expect this to continue in the short term. Long term, Apple will trade based on fundamentals; short-term and trades on mood and feeling; not terribly rational inputs. The market trades based on data, current perception of that data and future expectations. And institutional as well as individual investors either know that fact and invest accordingly, or they are subject to these rapidly changing trading conditions and are victims. This is why it is important to understand the time horizon is key when determining your investment strategy. If you are a short-term investor you better have a pretty good handle on mood and sentiment. If you are a long-term investor you better have a pretty good concept of the fundamentals and trends that will affect the asset you are investing in. And perhaps most importantly, remember that when you read headlines or hear interviews that opinions change and often do. Use interviews, columns, insights and protestations from those in the media as information to consider but not gospel and certainly not permanent ideology. This means that in the end your opinion matters as well as well as your interpretation of others' viewpoints. So the next time you read a headline that a prominent investor has adjusted a strategy after making previous statements about the wisdom of a particular course of action, remember that perspectives change. Just because you read it or hear it doesn't mean it's permanent, and you should assume that every opinion that you hear is subject to adjustment prior to relying on that view when you make an investment decision. Michael Yoshikami is the CEO and founder of the investment committee of Destination Wealth Management. "

"title": "Tesco may launch tablet to rival cheap androids ", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Getty Images Global supermarket chain Tesco plans to launch a tablet device that will rival the likes of Apple and Amazon, the Sunday Times newspaper reported on the weekend, with analysts saying a Tesco tablet could prove popular at the cheap end of the market. The newspaper said that Tesco is looking to enter the fiercely competitive tablet market with its own device that will come loaded with books, films and music, and could hit the shelves in time for Christmas. The tablet is also expected to have apps that allow access to the supermarket's online grocery store and bank deals, as well as Tesco's own music and film download service, Blinkbox. If successful, the product could help revive Tesco's DVD and book sales market, which has been put under pressure from online retailers like Amazon. However, analysts are mixed in their views on whether the supermarket chain's tablet will impact an already-saturated consumer area. 'The biggest challenge that Tesco faces is to get consumers to buy the tablet. They need a unique selling point. What are they going to bring to make it different?' Neil Saunders, retail analyst at Conlumino, told CNBC. 'It won't be a game changer to their sales fortunes and it seems to be more of an experiment.' But one analyst said that a Tesco tablet was 'not a bad proposition' for a certain market. 'There is a market for iPads and quite separately there is a market for very cheap generic android tablets, and this is where Tesco's device falls,' Benedict Evans, analyst at Enders Analysis, told CNBC. He said it was likely the Tesco product would be sold at around 150 pounds and therefore would appeal to a wide audience. Extensive details of the tablet were not available, but the Sunday Times cited industry sources who said the product would be 'high quality' and similar to Amazon's Kindle. Tesco's new concept store: more than just a gimmick? Tesco has unveiled a brand new concept store in the UK in Watford. Tesco Extra is the latest experiment in transforming the supermarket into a retail destination. If Tesco go ahead with the plan, it will not be the first supermarket to take on the tablet market. Asda, the store owned by Walmart, released the Arnova 8 in 2011 costing around 100 pounds. For Tesco, the tablet would not only be used to drive sales, but would also be key in 'brand building', according to Chris Lewis, a telecoms and ICT analyst at Lewis Insight. 'Tesco are putting their device out there so they can use it as a window into the Tesco world and it is part of that brand building,' Lewis told CNBC. 'They have to use all possible channels to drive the customer through to the product. Tesco will see it as an extension of their brand to reach the customer.' Tesco has been trying to appease investors after sales at its UK stores fell 1 percent in the 13 weeks to May 25. The supermarket chain is investing 1 billion pounds in a turnaround plan to improve its performance in the U.K., where it makes two-thirds of its profits. Tesco made no comment on the reports that it was launching a tablet device. By CNBC's Arjun Kharpal: Follow him on Twitter @ArjunKharpal and @CNBCWorld "

"title": "Silicon Valley start-ups take perks to new level", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Source: OpenDNS OpenDNS employees take Yoga lessons on their company rooftop. Most people consider themselves lucky if they can land a job with above average pay, a 401 and a healthy number of paid vacation days. But in Silicon Valley, that's just where the benefits begin. Start-ups based in San Francisco Bay area are offering novel perksmassages, body analytics, subsidized rents, trips to Tahoe and even helicopter ridesin hopes they will beat competitors to top talent. 'At big tech firms, you can get your dry cleaning on campus, nails done, breakfast, lunch, dinner, just things that make it easier to work longer,' said Carolyn Betts, CEO of ,San Francisco-based Betts Recruiting, which specializes in hiring for tech start-ups. 'With start-ups, it's the same thing. They are trying to do whatever they can to mimic these larger companies so that they can compete for the same talent.' Making it personal While Google, Apple, Facebook and other Silicon Valley giants may offer employees huge salaries and their own set of fancy perks, start-ups are taking a more personal approach. For example, the video monitoring hardware and software company Dropcam offers each employee a free helicopter ridepiloted by the company CEO Greg Duffyto the destination of their choice. Weebly, a website creation tool, gives each employee a monthly credit of $50 to Exec, which provides an on-demand errand service. And OpenDNS, an enterprise network security company, takes all of its employeesas well as their familieson a paid trip to Tahoe each year where they stay at the Ritz Carlton. While the trip to Tahoe allows employees a chance to relax and get to know each other, other perks offered back at the office are meant to make workers' lives more simple, said David Ulevitch, founder and CEO of OpenDNS. 'The goal with anything perks-wise is about making life easier,' Ulevitch said. 'Work is stressful, you literally spend the majority of your life at work, so we want to create things that make their lives easier.' Some of these benefits include a laundry service, free catered lunches throughout the week, and rooftop yoga twice a week. Healthy perks Health and well-being benefits are a common theme among start-up perks, but the companies aren't just giving away gym memberships. For example, Weebly offers each employee access to two free annual WellnessFX draws, which provides a personalized assessment of a user's blood chemistry and then breaks down the health data in easy-to-understand charts. The company also pays for massages and yoga classes every other week. But one of the key ways Weebly and many other start-ups are trying to encourage a healthy lifestyle is by giving employees flexible work schedules and unlimited vacation days. 'We're not treating everyone like children. We give our employees more flexibility, and people regulate themselves and regulate their work,' said David Rusenko, Weebly's CEO. 'People definitely rise to the occasion.' As long as employees are getting their work done, they can come and go as they please from the office, he said. The company's vacation policy is similar. 'We offer flexible vacation. We ask that employees keep it reasonable, but tell them to take as much vacation as they need,' Rusenko said. Such liberal leave policies are about more than making sure employees have sufficient time off; they also help promote a healthy work-life balance, said Greg Schott, CEO of MuleSoft, a software and consulting company. 'Some start-ups have that 24 hour, work every single night schedule. Ours tends to be that our employees can work from home or in evening if they have something to do like go to a parent-teacher conference,' Schott said. All you can eat Source: OpenDNS OpenDNS office lounge features a fully stocked bar. The bottom line is that even with flexible work schedules, start-up employees will still end up spending tons of time at the office. But while they're there, they will eat like kings. Providing employees with free food, as well as alcohol, is probably the most popular perk among start-ups in the Valley. Sure, small start-ups don't have a Google-size cafeteria, but thanks to local catering businesses, the firms are able to provide free meals for their employees. Thumbtack, a company that operates an online marketplace where people can book local services, has an in-house chef who makes breakfast, lunch and dinner for employees. The company also has a dinner every Wednesday where employees are encouraged to bring their friends and family. OpenDNS offers free lunch three days a week, which includes a different food truck at its office every Wednesday. Pinterest brings in food from restaurants everyday for lunch and dinner and Weebly has two meals a day catered for its employees. Along with food, though, many start-ups also keep their offices stocked with alcoholic beverages. OpenDNS, for example, brought in a vintage bar that it keeps full of booze. The cost Source: Mulesoft MuleSoft flies in all of its international employees to a West Coast retreat each year. While all the free food, booze and trips have no financial impact on the employees, the perks certainly impact the company that is footing the bill. However, it's a small price to pay to maintain a company culture that attracts talent, start-up execs said. 'Competition for talent is probably about as intense as it has ever been, including during the bubble,' Schott said. 'It's a really hot hiring climate. People are in high demand. You have to have something superior in order to recruit people.' In other words, you have to spend money to make money, a notion that investors in these start-ups support. "

"title": "UPDATE 1-Conde Nast launches new subscriber service with Amazon", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " NEW YORK Aug 20 - Magazine publisher Conde Nast announced a major partnership with Amazon.com Inc on Tuesday in which the Internet retailer will handle print anddigital subscriptions for glossy publications such as Vogue, Wired and Vanity Fair.Conde Nast is the first magazine publisher to collaborate with Amazon on this type of service, a move that will simplify and eventually save money on its subscription process and give it access to a huge new customer base. Currently, subscriptions involve direct mail and stacks of magazine insert cards.Amazon will allow consumers to purchase, manage and renew their subscriptions for seven of its top titles under a new 'all access' plan that gives them both print and digital editions of select magazines using their Amazon accounts.For the time being, readers can still subscribe using the old paper-based method, but the idea is that Amazon will eventually handle all Conde Nast's magazine subscriptions if the arrangement is successful.For Amazon, it marks a new step into handling content, following forays into film and lending books. It gives the online retailer a chance to offer subscriptions to its more than 200 million customers and cross-sell goods to Conde Nast subscribers with the easy 'one-click' purchasing system.'It's part of the Amazon initiative to improve its overall content portfolio,' said R.J. Hottovy, an analyst at Morningstar. 'It's a matter of getting more people to Amazon. It entices them to make more purchases elsewhere on Amazon, which should have some revenue and margin improvement opportunities.'But it is just one piece of Amazon's ever-growing business, and likely not the lynchpin of any grand new strategy.'It's a pretty small agreement in the grand scheme of things for Amazon,' said Aaron Kessler at Raymond James. 'But it's definitely a positive if Amazon can become the backbone for more digital subscriptions.'Analysts said it would make sense for Amazon to target other publishers' subscription services, but the company declined to give details about its plans.An obvious target would The Washington Post, which Amazon Chief Executive Jeff Bezos bought for $250 million earlier this month.THE PLANConde Nast will offer readers a combined $6 introductory rate for six months of both the online and print versions of one of the following magazines: Vogue, Glamour, Bon Appetit, Lucky, Golf Digest, Vanity Fair and Wired.It plans to add its other 11 consumer titles, including the New Yorker, later in the year.Readers can still subscribe the old way through Conde Nast, and can also subscribe online through existing partner Apple Inc .The digital subscriptions will be made available on several mobile platforms, including the Kindle Fire, Apple's iPad and Google Inc's Android tablets and phones.It will introduce Conde Nast to new readers through Amazon's massive customer base.'We are using the partnership with Amazon to make purchasing and renewing subscriptions as easy as humanly possible,' Bob Sauerberg, president of Conde Nast, said in an interview last Wednesday.'We want to go from selling print subscriptions to selling access to all our content,' he added, referring to the introductory offer that allows readers to get online and print subscriptions bundled together for individual titles.Currently, online readers count for only about 4 percent of Conde Nast's total circulation of about 18.5 million copies, according to the Alliance for Audited Media. That suggests the glossy magazine as a physical object is not likely to disappear any time soon.'Magazines have real deep value in both formats,' said Russ Grandinetti, vice president of Kindle Content at Amazon. 'A lot of consumers want to keep one foot in both camps.'STRIKING DEALSSauerberg and Grandinetti started to talk about a potential partnership over breakfast during the magazine trade organization MPA's annual conference last year.'For years we have worked hard at trying to make buying anything really easy,' Grandinetti said. 'Even though people really love magazines, I would not say they love the process of maintaining their subscription.'Increasing digital copies is a key part of the magazine's industry future success as more people choose to read on smartphones and tablets, while advertisers are placing more dollars toward digital displays at the expense of print.At the same time, mobile device makers have a huge appetite for media content, including magazines, newspapers and TV shows to spur people to buy tablets and smartphones.Bezos' move to buy The Washington Post ignited speculation that he would transform the paper into a streaming news service delivered to tablets, computers and phones. Grandinetti would not comment on any plans involving the Post, adding that the paper is solely under Bezos' ownership.Even as tech companies court publishers, media companies have had an uneasy relationship with Silicon Valley since watching the music industry dwindle as people flocked to buy songs on iTunes for much less than the price of a CD.For example, Time Inc, a division of Time Warner Inc , the largest magazine publisher in the United States, was one of the last holdouts to join Apple's newsstand. The standoff was because the world's largest technology company did not want to share subscriber data with the publisher of Sports Illustrated and People.Subscriber information is critical to magazine publishers, who use it to give advertisers a better picture about their readers.Conde Nast is usually one of the first to wade into the water with innovations. For instance, it was the first to offer subscriptions through Apple's newsstand with the New Yorker.'We really try and connect with the tech companies on the West Coast,' Sauerberg said. 'We know what we're good at and they know what they are good at.'In the agreement with Amazon, Sauerberg said Amazon is providing the same consumer data Conde Nast would get when a reader subscribes directly through the company.Amazon is taking a cut of the subscription revenue, although both companies declined to provide details. In other arrangements, Amazon typically takes 30 percent. "

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " OTTAWA, Aug 21 - The Canadian government is watching smartphone maker BlackBerry Ltd carefully as it explores options including sale of the company but will not comment on its affairs, Industry Minister James Moore said on Wednesday.Loss-making BlackBerry, which has bled market share to Apple's iPhone and phones using Google's Android operating system, said last week it was weighing options that could include an outright sale.The company's new phones, introduced earlier this year, have sold less quickly than expected and BlackBerry expects more red ink for the current quarter at least.Speaking in an interview with Reuters, Moore said it was 'unfortunate' that BlackBerry's new Q10 and the Z10 smartphones had not taken off with consumers.'I know that they're facing their challenges and they're adjusting their firm internally in the way that best suits their interests,' he said. 'And all I can say is, we wish them well, and we're keeping a close eye on the situation.'Moore declined to speculate about whether a foreign bid for BlackBerry could run afoul of national security regulations. Asked if the government wanted BlackBerry to stay Canadian, he replied: 'We want them to do well, keep employing Canadians, keeping putting out innovative technologies and platforms, and we're paying close attention.'BlackBerry, formerly known as Research In Motion, made on-your-hip email possible with its first pagers and smartphones, coupled with strong security features.But the company was slow to embrace the important consumer market and rivals are rapidly pushing into the corporate and government market that BlackBerry used to own.

She called Tim Cook.'He basically explained nicely that my job was to do the things that Mark did not want to focus on as much,' Sandberg said of the 2007 meeting that lasted several hours with the chief operating officer of Apple Inc.'That was his job with Steve . And he explained that the job would change over time and I should be prepared for that.'While Sandberg has enjoyed a steady run at Facebook, it is Cook's job that has changed radically since then. Now, the man who was handed one of the more daunting tasks in business - filling the shoes of the late Steve Jobs and keeping Apple on top - may himself need a spot of advice.Two years into Cook's tenure, Apple is expected to unveil a redesigned iPhone next month. It will be a key moment for Cook. The company he inherited has become a very different creature: a mature corporate behemoth rather than a scrappy industry pioneer, with its share price down 5 percent this year, despite a recent rally. The S&P 500 is up about 15 percent this year.A transition was, perhaps, inevitable after an astonishing five-year run in which Apple's headcount tripled, its revenues rose over six-fold, its profits grew 12-fold, and its stock price jumped from $150 to a peak of $705 last fall.But it's been painful for some.It is unclear whether the spread-sheeting-loving, consensus-oriented, even-keeled Cook can successfully reshape the cult-like culture that Jobs built. Though Cook has deftly managed the iPhone and iPad product lines, which continue to deliver enormous profits, Apple has yet to launch a major new product under Cook; talk of watches and televisions remains just that.Some worry that Cook's changes to the culture have doused the fire - and perhaps the fear - that drove employees to try to achieve the impossible.CAN NICE GUYS FINISH FIRST?Cook is known as a workaholic who guards his privacy closely. People who know him well paint a portrait of a thoughtful, data-driven executive who knows how to listen and who can be charming and funny in small group settings.Lisa Cooper, who went to high school with Cook in Robertsville, Alabama, and remains a friend, still laughs at memories of Cook staging prank photos for the school yearbook and crooning 'The Way We Were' to her in class.In the day to day at Apple, Cook has established a methodical, no-nonsense style, one that's as different as could be from that of his predecessor.Jobs' bi-monthly iPhone software meeting, in which he would go through every planned features of the company's flagship product, is gone.'That's not Tim's style at all,' said one person familiar with those meetings. 'He delegates.'Still, he has a tough side. In meetings, Cook is so calm as to be nearly unreadable, sitting silently with hands clasped in front of himself. Any change in the constant rocking of his chair is one sign subordinates look for: when he simply listens, they're heartened if there is no change in the pace of his rocking.'He could skewer you with a sentence,' the person said. 'He would say something along the lines of 'I don't think that's good enough' and that would be the end of it and you would just want to crawl into a hole and die.' Apple declined to comment on Cook or the company for this article.Cook's fans say that his methodical manner doesn't get in the way of decisive action. They point to the Apple Maps fiasco, in which Apple replaced Google's mapping product with its own on the iPhone and it quickly became clear that Apple's maps were not ready for prime time.Apple initially downplayed the glitches by saying Maps was a 'major initiative' and they were 'just getting started.' But behind the scenes, Cook bypassed Scott Forstall, the mobile software chief who was responsible for maps, and tasked internet services honcho Eddy Cue with figuring out what exactly happened and what should be done.Cook had a lot of questions, and the episode also prompted him to fast-track his thinking on the future direction of the critical phone and tablet software known as iOS, a person close to Apple recounted.Cook soon issued a public apology to customers, fired Forstall, and handed responsibility for software design to Jony Ive, a Jobs soul-mate who had previously been in charge only of hardware design.'The vision that Tim had to involve Jony and to essentially connect two very, very important Apple initiatives or areas of focus - that was a big decision on Tim's part and he made it independently and very, very resolutely,' said Bob Iger, CEO of Walt Disney Co. and an Apple director.Still, employees report some grumbling, and Apple seems to have taken note, conducting a survey of morale in the critical hardware engineering unit earlier this year.'As our business continues to grow and face new challenges, it becomes increasingly important to get feedback about your perceptions and experiences working in hardware engineering,' Dan Riccio, Apple's senior vice president of Hardware Engineering, wrote to his team in February in an email seen by Reuters.Some Silicon Valley recruiters and former Apple employees at rival companies say they are seeing more Apple resumes than ever before, especially from hardware engineers, though the depth and breadth of any brain-drain remains difficult to quantify, especially given the recent expansion in staff numbers.'I am being inundated by LinkedIn messages and emails both by people who I never imagined would leave Apple and by people who have been at Apple for a year, and who joined expecting something different than what they encountered,' said one recruiter with ties to Apple.Still, the Cook regime is also seen as kinder and gentler, and that's been a welcome change for many.'It is not as crazy as it used to be. It is not as draconian,' said Beth Fox, a recruiting consultant and former Apple employee, adding that the people she knows are staying put. 'They like Tim. They tend to err on the optimistic side.'SOCIAL SIDEThere does seem to be, under Cook, a new willingness to admit mistakes and a more open approach to problems such as poor working conditions at Chinese contract manufacturers.'On the social side, the only way for Apple to make a difference in the world in a broad way is to be - I believe strongly - is to be totally transparent,' Cook said earlier this year at what was, paradoxically, a closed-door talk at his business school reunion.'When you do that, you make a decision to report the bad and the good, and we hope that by doing that, that it puts pressure on everyone else to join.'Under pressure from investors, Cook not only agreed to share more of Apple's $150 billion cash hoard with shareholders, he voluntarily tied his own pay more closely to stock performance.Yet critics wonder whether Cook's stated commitments to transparency and workers' rights really amount to much. Cook set up the global manufacturing system being criticized, and the company and its CEO remain highly secretive about matters large and small. Conditions at some Chinese factories have improved -Apple now tracks and reports hours of a million workers to avoid illegal overtime - but allegations of unfair working conditions continue to be made.Apple has also come under scrutiny over its tax structure, under which it has kept billions of dollars in profits in Irish subsidiaries so as to pay little or no taxes. Cook defended the policy, which is legal, at a Congressional hearing in May.Shareholders, meanwhile, are focused on the bottom line, and the next big product launch. A sharp drop in China revenue in April-June underscores the challenges Apple faces in its second-largest market as the technology gap with cheaper local rivals narrows and as Samsung Electronics keeps up a steady stream of new models across all price ranges.Cook got a vote of confidence this month when activist investor Carl Icahn disclosed he had amassed a large position in Apple stock.Bob Iger, the Apple director, said Cook had taken on 'a very, very difficult role given the person that he's succeeded and the company he's running.''I think he's done so with a deft hand, a strong sense of himself,' said Iger, who himself long toiled as the number two to a celebrated CEO, Michael Eisner. 'With that comes a real self-honesty that he is who he is, and not what the world expects him to be, or what Steve was. And I like that.' "

"title": "Will China embrace the gold iPhone?", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Muriel de Seze If Apple hopes to woo more Chinese by adding a glitzy coating - some call it champagne, some gold - to its next iPhone, it may be in for a surprise. While gold is hugely popular as a safe haven and a status symbol - China is set to overtake India as the world's biggest gold consumer this year - shoppers at an Apple store in Beijing weren't all convinced it should be coupled with that pinnacle of mobile gadgetry. Ni Suyang, a 49-year old worker at a Beijing state-owned enterprise, said that color mattered less to her than the glass surface and silver metallic finish. 'A gold color looks high-end but is a little tacky,' she said. Gold and mobile phones are not strangers. Britain's Gold & Co makes gold-plated iPhones, iPads and BlackBerrys which it also sells in India and China. In Shenzhen many small local brands make gold-plated feature phones and smartphones. The less well-heeled can adorn their devices with jewel-studded and gold phone covers. Apple's decision to add a champagne or gold covered iPhone to its range - confirmed by supply chain sources in Taiwan - would be a departure from its black and white norm. Apple could be not reached for comment. Commercially it makes sense, said Jerry Zou, Senior VP and Partner at FleishmanHillard, a public relations firm in Beijing. New colors would add 'novelty and variety, both of which are key to winning over fickle Chinese consumers'. A champagne color 'would convey an image suggesting high-end luxury but a bit more restrained and subtle'. Is Apple overpriced? Adrian Drury, principal analyst for media and broadcast at Ovum, and Sharif Sakr, senior European editor at Engadget, discuss Apple stock, and stress that Apple needs a 'knock-out release' of its new iPhone. All that glitters... But browsers at Apple's Xidan store weren't so sure - even on which gender would like it. 'Gold is for guys, I think,' said 22-year old Meng Xiang, a retail buyer working in Guangzhou, who said she preferred pink and white. 'I would consider buying a gold iPhone for my boyfriend.' Cui Baocheng, a 48-year-old bank manager, disagreed. 'I prefer black to gold,' he said. 'Men usually like black. Champagne might be very ugly.' Indeed, there's a danger that by trying to broaden its appeal Apple may end up undermining what makes the iPhone so desirable in the first place. Younger Chinese see gold as old-fashioned and tacky, and are increasingly opting for platinum - dubbed 'white gold' in Chinese - for weddings and gifts. 'An iPhone with more colors means that Apple is adapting to consumers' tastes, especially a gold color that Chinese people like,' said Xu Fang, a 28-year old real estate agent. 'However, I think this might undermine the value and uniqueness of the brand.' Apple's sales in Greater China, its second biggest market, slumped 43 percent in April-June from the previous quarter. Its market share has almost halved since last year to below 5 percent, according to industry researcher Canalys. The bigger problem, says Shanghai-based product designer Brandon Edwards, is that while gold added 'cultural relevance on top of Apple's inherent brand value' and may attract premium users from other brands, 'Apple's main issue in China and emerging markets is centred around acquiring new customers, and this doesn't hit those people at all'. Indeed, consumers in India, where Apple's market share is just over 2 percent, were just as skeptical. Mumbai phone retailer Manish Khatri said he did occasionally get customers asking for gold-colored phones, but the biggest deterrent to buying an iPhone for most of them was cost. For others, gold is something to buy, not to slap on a mobile device. Said Vikas Jindal, a 35-year old Delhi businessman and a regular buyer of gold: 'I'll look stupid if I carry a gold-colored phone. A phone should be simple and sober. ' "

Planning dinner in September. Tim believes in buyback and is doing one. What will be discussed is magnitude,' the billionaire said on Twitter without elaborating.Apple was not immediately available for comment.Icahn, the hedge fund billionaire known for launching aggressive assaults on American boardrooms, caused a sensation on Wall Street last week when he revealed on Twitter he had taken a large position in Apple and was pushing for the company to expand its program of share buybacks, already one of the market's largest.That revelation pushed shares of the $400 billion corporation up 5 percent.In April, Apple bowed to Wall Street pressure and said it would return $100 billion to shareholders by the end of 2015 - double the amount set aside previously. It got there in part by raising its dividend 15 percent and boosting its share buyback program six-fold to $60 billion, one of the largest of its kindAs part of that program, it bought about more than $16 billion worth of stock in the June quarter, much more than analysts had expected.Icahn told Reuters at the time that the iPhone, iPad and Mac computer maker has the ability to do a $150 billion buyback now by borrowing funds at 3 percent. And he argued that by increasing its program, Apple's stock could regain the $700 level it touched in September. "

A source familiar with the matter described the problem as a 'data feed issue.'Rival exchanges halted trading of Nasdaq-listed shares shortly afterward at the request of Nasdaq, the second-biggest U.S. stock exchange operator.Options trading was also halted, the exchange added.The interruption means that investors had very limited market access to trade such familiar names as Apple Inc , Facebook Inc and Microsoft Corp. In all, Nasdaq lists about 3,200 shares.'I can't remember this happening in recent memory,' said Christopher Nagy, president of consultancy firm KOR Trading and a former head of trading at TD Ameritrade.'As we continue to eliminate human beings from the execution of security trading, this is the problem you run into,' said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. 'These events are going to take place, given the level of automation.'Trading of shares not listed on Nasdaq continued, but transactions could not be executed on the Nasdaq platform.Major market gauges such as the Nasdaq Composite Index and Nasdaq 100 were also affected. The composite had been up 0.87 percent when the disruptions struck and the 100 index was up 0.75 percent.The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index, which includes around 100 stocks listed on Nasdaq and as a result were not trading, was up about 0.75 percent on the session.Nasdaq declined to comment immediately beyond the electronic alerts it was issuing to traders. When trading resumes, estimated to be around 2:30 p.m., Nasdaq said it will precede the start with a 15-minute period when only price quote traffic will be permitted, not actual trades.The New York Stock Exchange's parent, NYSE Euronext, ceased all trading in Nasdaq-listed shares at the request of Nasdaq.BATS Global Markets, a stock exchange operator that itself was hit with a nearly hour-long outage on Aug. 6 , said it also disabled trading in some Nasdaq securities.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was monitoring developments and in touch with the exchanges.'I would not want to speculate other than to say this is huge.

"content": " NEW YORK, Aug 22 - Trading in a large part of the U.S. stock market came to a halt for much of Thursday after an unexplained issue shut down trading of Nasdaq-listed securities, the latest black eye for the U.S. securities trading business.The abrupt halt shortly after noon caused trading in shares of Apple, Google, Microsoft and more than 3,000 other U.S. companies to stop.Nasdaq resumed trading at around 3:25 p.m. EDT , ending a roughly 3-hour, 11-minute shutdown that was the longest in recent memory.'Any brokerage firm gets paid by executing orders,' said Sal Arnuk, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading in Chatham, New Jersey. 'So yes, we are frustrated, and this hurts us, it hurts the market and it hurts public confidence.'All traffic through Nasdaq had stopped at 12:14:03 p.m. , and the exchange and its larger rival, NYSE Euronext's New York Stock Exchange, said all trades executed between then and 12:23:31 p.m. would stand.Trading in a single stock resumed at about 3 p.m., and other stocks followed. Nasdaq's own stock, which had been up 0.8 percent prior to the halt, traded down as much as 5.4 percent after trading resumed.Nasdaq blamed a problem with distributing stock price quotes for the shutdown.

Options trading was also halted.'I can't remember this happening in recent memory,' said Christopher Nagy, president of consultancy firm KOR Trading and a former head of trading at TD Ameritrade.The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said it was in touch with the exchanges, with Chairman Mary Jo White overseeing developments from her home office near New York City.White House spokesman Josh Earnest said President Barack Obama had also been briefed about the disruption.The interruption means that investors had very limited market access to trade such familiar names as Apple Inc , Facebook Inc, Google Inc and Microsoft Corp. In all, Nasdaq lists about 3,200 shares.'As we continue to eliminate human beings from the execution of security trading, this is the problem you run into,' said Stephen Massocca, managing director of Wedbush Equity Management LLC in San Francisco. 'These events are going to take place, given the level of automation.'TECHNICAL GLITCHESThe outage was the latest black eye for Nasdaq, which in May agreed to pay $10 million, the largest penalty ever levied against a stock exchange, to settle SEC civil charges over mistakes in handling the Facebook IPO.James Angel, a Georgetown University finance professor who also sits on the board of rival exchange operator Direct Edge, said Nasdaq appeared to take steps to ensure that trading reopen in an orderly fashion and with correct pricing.'We can live with the market being closed for a little bit, but we can't live with bad pricing,' he said. 'It's far better to have the market shut down and take its time re-opening, than to have what happened with the Facebook incident... It looks like they've learned their lesson.'William Lefkowitz, options strategist at National Securities in New York, said options trading in such companies as International Business Machines Corp dried up during the halt. But he said the reopening was 'very orderly and liquidity is back to normal. It is almost like it did not happen.'Thursday's outage was the latest high-profile glitch in U.S. stock markets.On Tuesday, a technical problem at Goldman Sachs Group Inc resulted in a flood of erroneous orders being sent to U.S. equity options markets.Two weeks earlier, on Aug. 6, stock exchange operator BATS Global Markets was hit with a nearly hour-long outage.Last year, a trading blowup at Knight Capital Group Inc was a contributing factor to the eventual sale of that company.'The frequency of technical issues affecting trading is a wake-up call to business leaders in capital markets,' said Lev Lesokhin, executive vice president of Cast, a specialist in business software analysis. 'They need to carefully scrutinize the structural integrity of their software systems.'Other trading venues were also affected by Thursday's outage, and several 'dark pools,' which execute orders anonymously, were forced to stop trading, according to several market participants.SECThursday's outage could cause problems for Nasdaq at the SEC, which has recently cracked down on stock exchanges to beef up their compliance with regulations and make sure they are policing themselves.White, who joined the regulator in April, is a Nasdaq veteran, having served on its board as recently as 2006.In June, a month after Nasdaq settled with the SEC over Facebook, the Chicago Board Options Exchange was ordered to pay $6 million to settle SEC charges that it failed to properly enforce short sale rules.The NYSE last year became the first exchange in SEC history to face a financial penalty after it supposedly gave some customers an 'improper head start' on trading information.In March, the SEC proposed rules to require exchanges and other trading platforms to be better prepared to handle major market disruptions, including those caused by technology glitches. Those reforms are still out for public comment. "

Planning dinner in September. Tim believes in buyback and is doing one.

The company averted a dispute with hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who sued Apple to try to block a proposal regarding voting on preferred shares. Einhorn later withdrew his lawsuit.Analysts said Icahn's interest in Apple helped cement improving sentiment on the stock, as investors began to anticipate a new line-up of gadgets in the fall, including possibly a cheaper iPhone that can spearheard a deeper drive into fast-growing emerging markets.Speculation has also persisted that the company may be planning some sort of TV or smartwatch product - worn on the user's wrist - in the near future.Cook said last month there will be products 'in new categories' but gave no details.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " OAKLAND, Calif. -- Pandora Media Inc.'s mobile business is finally paying off. The Internet radio company said that its second-quarter results benefited from a nearly 60 percent jump in revenue as it made more money from its mobile unit.But Pandora's shares fell in after-hours trading as it issued a third-quarter earnings outlook that was below what Wall Street analysts were expecting.The Oakland, Calif.-based company reported a loss of $7.8 million, or 4 cents per share, in the three months ended July 31. It posted a loss of $5.4 million, or 3 cents per share, in the same period a year ago.Excluding stock-based compensation costs and other items, Pandora earned 4 cents per share, up from 1 cent per share a year ago.Revenue grew 55 percent to $157.4 million in the second quarter from $101.3 million a year ago. Most of that revenue growth came from Pandora's mobile business, which grew 92 percent from last year to $116 million.On average, analysts expected revenue of $156.3 million and earnings of 2 cents per share, according to FactSet.Pandora said that total listener hours rose 18 percent to 3.88 billion in the second quarter, from 3.3 billion a year ago.Looking ahead to the third quarter, the company expects revenue between $174 million and $179 million and adjusted earnings between 3 cents and 6 cents per share. Analysts expect revenue of $171 million and earnings of 8 cents per share for the quarter, according to FactSet.For the fiscal year, the company expects revenue between $640 million and $655 million and adjusted earnings between breakeven and 5 cents per share. Analysts expect revenue of $633.2 million and earnings of 4 cents per share for the year, according to FactSet.The company also said it reversed its decision to limit free listening on mobile devices. In March, Pandora had capped free listening on mobile devices to 40 hours per month to limit royalty costs and convert more listeners into subscribers. While the limit was in place, Pandora said it only affected under 4 percent of its total monthly active listeners.Pandora is facing increased competition this year. It already competes with Spotify, Google Inc. and others in the space, and Apple Inc. plans to launch its own radio service in the fall.Shares of Pandora fell $1.46, or 6.7 percent, to $20.25 in after-hours trading Thursday, after closing up 22 cents at $21.71 during the regular trading session.

"content": " SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 22 - Internet radio service Pandora Media Inc said on Thursday that rising expenditures to acquire music and expand its sales force would push fiscal 2014 earnings below analyst expectations, and its shares slumped 5 percent.The company also backtracked on a 40-hour monthly limit on free music streaming that was announced just six months ago, a measure originally implemented to control rising costs. Pandora said it will lift the monthly cap Sept. 1 after watching its margins improve.The mixed message added to a sense of uncertainty surrounding Pandora, which has otherwise reclaimed favor recently on Wall Street. Aside from Spotify and Rdio, its usual rivals, Pandora will soon face competition from Apple Inc , which is preparing to launch its iTunes Radio offering in the coming weeks.Excluding certain items, Pandora said it expected to earn between 0 and 5 cents per share for the year. That was below the 5 cent profit expected by analysts polled by Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S.Its shares fell to $20.50 in extended trade.But for the second quarter, Pandora exceeded expectations, posting revenue of $162 million, a 58 percent rise, as it continued to pick up listeners. Its earnings of 4 cents also topped Wall Street expectations of 2 cents.In an interview, Chief Executive Joe Kennedy said he felt confident the company has proven its mobile monetization strategy. But he signaled that earnings would be depressed in the near future as he pursued an aggressive investment strategy. In the past year, for instance, the company has increased its sales force by three-quarters, he said.'We're taking the increased margin that we're getting and reallocating to invest in future growth,' Kennedy said on Thursday. 'But everything says we're firing on all cylinders. We're still in the earliest days. We have to invest to make the most of a huge opportunity.'Kennedy downplayed the threat of competitors, saying that 7 percent of all radio listening was on Pandora, making it the most popular online radio option.'We've been on the market now for 8 years, and we've had competitors large and small,' he told Reuters. 'We're still the undisputed leader.'Kennedy told analysts the company would keep its international expansion plans on hold but continue to aggressively expand at the local level by selling targeted ads for local businesses. But that would mean a significant effort to ramp up sales across the country, he warned.Steven Frankel, an analyst at Dougherty & Co, said it was disappointing to see that 'hard fought monetization gains aren't going to translate into bottom line upside.''This guidance is a reflection that this is a very difficult and expensive business to scale,' Frankel said. 'Just when we thought we understood all the cost dynamics, there's another layer of complexity here.'Pandora's shares, which fluctuated wildly for the first year after its June 2011 initial public offering, surged to a record closing high of $21.71 on Thursday.Pandora users listened to the service for a total of 3.88 billion hours during the quarter, an 18 percent increase from 3.30 billion hours a year ago, the company said.Sameet Sinha, an analyst at B. Riley & Co, said although Apple's entry into the market could siphon away some listeners, it could ultimately help Pandora by expanding the market for Internet radio advertising.The iPhone-maker has already signed up advertisers including McDonald's, Pepsi and Procter and Gamble ahead of the radio service's imminent launch, according to an AdAge report.'If Apple can prove to those advertisers that Internet radio works, then you could expect to see a lot of advertising dollars come into the market,' Sinha said.

"content": " * China Mobile awards initial 4G contracts worth $3.2 bln* Huawei, ZTE get more than half of total* Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent, Nokia Siemens secure a third* China Mobile says 4G tender going smoothlySINGAPORE, Aug 23 - China Mobile Ltd has awarded initial 4G contracts worth around 20 billion yuan , with Chinese firms securing more than half of the biggest prize in the global telecoms industry this year and foreign firms winning about a third, industry sources said.Telecoms equipment makers, such as global leader Ericsson and Huawei Technologies Co Ltd, have been waiting for China Mobile's 4G tender to lift the fortunes of an industry that has been hit by a lack of spending worldwide.The development of a 4G network by the carrier, which with more than 700 million mobile customers is the world's largest by subscribers, is also regarded as key to it clinching an agreement with Apple Inc to carry its blockbuster iPhone.'This is the tender that global telecom equipment vendors have been vying for this year,' said an industry source.'Even though we see Huawei and ZTE getting the bulk of the contracts and foreign vendors getting around a third, I'm sure they will keep going back to China Mobile and get a bit more share.'Shenzhen-based Huawei and crosstown rival ZTE have obtained about 25 percent each of the total 4G procurement in China Mobile's tender this year, said the sources, who are familiar with the negotiations but declined to be identified because they are not authorised to speak to the media.European vendors Ericsson, Alcatel-Lucent SA and Nokia Siemens Networks have obtained a share of around 10 percent each, the sources said.The first wave of 4G investments that began in 2010 in Japan and Korea favoured Ericsson and NSN, while the second in the United States went largely to Ericsson and Alcatel-Lucent. Huawei won a chunk of Europe's 4G contracts last year.Some western markets have been wary of using Huawei and ZTE equipment on their networks.The European Union has been considering launching an investigation into whether both Chinese firms benefit from illegal government subsidies, while a U.S. congressional committee is probing whether their equipment poses national security risks.STEP TOWARDS IPHONE DEALChina Mobile said in an emailed statement that the tender had indeed begun and the progress had been smooth, with the carrier planning to build 200,000 base stations this year, in line with its previous target.Huawei and Ericsson could not be reached immediately for comment. ZTE declined to comment, while Alcatel-Lucent said it had not yet heard of any official decision from China Mobile.So far, China Mobile has only spent around a third of its full-year capital expenditure of 190.2 billion yuan in the first half, with the market expecting spending to speed up once the tender takes place.ZTE, which is listed in Hong Kong and Shenzhen, is expected to post a third quarterly profit for the July-September period due to cost-cutting measures and as it shunned low-margin contracts that resulted in its first-ever annual loss last year.'We believe telcos' capex will be heavily skewed to the second half of 2013, which will refuel ZTE's carrier networks segment's momentum,' brokerage CMB International said in a report.'ZTE withdrew from some overseas market and re-focused on domestic operator's contracts to protect margin.'The Chinese government is likely to issue licences later this year, which will help China Mobile compete better with its rivals China Unicom and China Telecom, which have better 3G technologies.And with Apple expected to unveil its next iPhone and a cheaper version next month that will likely support China Mobile's 4G TD-LTE technology, everything seems to be falling in place for the two giants to sign an agreement.China Mobile is the only Chinese carrier without an iPhone contract, which will be key to lifting the percentage of higher-end, data-crunching users on its network.By mid-morning, China Mobile's shares had risen 0.3 percent, while ZTE's stock was down 0.3 percent, underperforming the main Hang Seng Index's 0.5 percent gain.

"title": "Carl Icahn plans dinner date with Apples Tim Cook", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Getty Images Tim Cook and Carl Icahn Carl Icahn has spoken again with Apple's Tim Cook and plans a longer discussion with the chief executive over dinner next month about the size of the iPhone maker's buyback program, the activist investor tweeted on Thursday. The hedge fund billionaire, known for launching aggressive assaults on American boardrooms, caused a sensation last week when he revealed on Twitter he had taken a large position in Apple and was pushing for the company to expand its program of share buybacks -- already one of the market's largest. That revelation, including comments about how he thought the stock was undervalued, pushed shares of the $400 billion corporation up 5 percent on August 13. But on Thursday, Apple's stock held steady at about $501.11 in late trade on the Nasdaq, resuming trade after a glitch halted trading in Nasdaq-listed securities for more than two hours. Icahn's tweet on Thursday, which came during the trading suspension, did not reveal much else apart from the fact that he and Cook had made plans for an in-person tete-a-tete next month. 'Spoke to Tim. Planning dinner in September. Tim believes in buyback and is doing one. What will be discussed is magnitude,' the billionaire said on Twitter on Thursday, without elaborating. Apple did not respond to requests for comment. In April, the company bowed to Wall Street pressure and said it would return $100 billion to shareholders by the end of 2015 - double the amount set aside previously. It got there in part by raising its dividend 15 percent and boosting its share buyback program six-fold to $60 billion, one of the largest of its kind As part of that program, it bought about more than $16 billion worth of stock in the June quarter, much more than analysts had expected. Another assault Icahn told Reuters last week that the iPhone, iPad and Mac computer maker has the ability to do a $150 billion buyback now by borrowing funds at 3 percent. And he argued that by increasing its program, Apple's stock could regain the $700 level it touched in September. Icahn, who this year launched strong opposition to Michael Dell's $25 billion effort to take Dell private, did not say how many shares of Apple he holds. A source familiar with the matter, who declined to be named because Icahn hasn't disclosed his holdings in Apple, said the investor's stake was worth around $1 billion, a fraction of the company's market value of more than $400 billion. He is the second prominent activist to target Apple this year. The company averted a dispute with hedge fund manager David Einhorn of Greenlight Capital, who sued Apple to try to block a proposal regarding voting on preferred shares. Einhorn later withdrew his lawsuit. Analysts said Icahn's interest in Apple helped cement improving sentiment on the stock, as investors began to anticipate a new line-up of gadgets in the fall, including possibly a cheaper iPhone that can spearhead a deeper drive into fast-growing emerging markets. Speculation has also persisted that the company may be planning some sort of TV or smartwatch product - worn on the user's wrist - in the near future. Cook said last month there will be products 'in new categories' but gave no details. "

'That interest, however, does not extend to mere curiosity about the parties' confidential information where that information is not central to a decision on the merits.'A Samsung declined to comment, and Apple representatives did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Representatives for the First Amendment Coalition, an advocacy group that sought to have the information disclosed, could not be reached immediately.The two companies have been waging patent litigation across the globe since 2011, climaxing in a high-profile trial last year in San Jose, California. A jury awarded Apple over $1 billion, but U.S. District Judge Lucy Koh later slashed the award and ordered a retrial on some of the damages.In the run-up to trial last year, attorneys for both sides submitted several documents to the court that contained financial details in order to calculate damages. The details were redacted, and Reuters filed motions in the court to unseal the documents.Koh ruled against Apple and Samsung, saying the public's interest in understanding the proceedings outweighed the companies' rights to keep the information secret. However, the appeals court unanimously disagreed.'While protecting the public's interest in access to the courts, we must remain mindful of the parties' right to access those same courts upon terms which will not unduly harm their competitive interest,' Judge Sharon Prost wrote.The case in the Federal Circuit is Apple Inc vs. Samsung Electronics Co Ltd et al., 12-1600.

"content": " SAN FRANCISCO, Aug 23 - Microsoft Corp CEO Steve Ballmer unexpectedly announced on Friday that he would retire in 2014, 13 years after he took over the dominant personal computer software company and tried to steer it into growing markets like video games, portable music players, smartphones and tablets.The following is a chronology of events during Ballmer's time as Microsoft chief executive.1998 - Ballmer assumes role of president at Microsoft and takes charge of day-to-day operations. Prior to that, he led numerous divisions, including sales and support and operating-systems development.2000 - Ballmer succeeds Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates as CEO in January. The two met as students at Harvard University, where Gates lived down the hall from Ballmer. In 1975, 19-year-old Gates dropped out of Harvard and went on to found Microsoft along with Paul Allen.2001 - In November, Microsoft enters the gaming market with the North American release of its Xbox gaming console, competing with game consoles from Nintendo Co Ltd and Sony Corp. .2005 - Microsoft launches the next-generation Xbox 360 video game console in November, strengthening its foothold in the video game hardware market.2006 - Microsoft launches Zune portable music player in November. It is the first Microsoft-designed device to compete in a market dominated by Apple Inc's iPod. The music player does not gain enough of a market, and Microsoft discontinues selling it by mid-2012.2007 - In January, Microsoft unveils the Windows Vista, which becomes the company's least popular operating system.2008 -- Ballmer makes an unsolicited $44.6 billion, $31-per-share, cash-and-stock takeover offer to Yahoo Inc's board. Yahoo rejects the bid as too low.2009 - Microsoft revamps its search engine to counter Google Inc's dominance in the Web search and related advertising business. In May, Ballmer reveals the new search engine, dubbed 'Bing' that is set for a June release.2009 -- In July, Microsoft and Yahoo launch a 10-year Web search deal to challenge market leader Google. Under the deal, the two companies agree that Microsoft's Bing search engine will power search queries on Yahoo's sites. They have been in on-again, off-again talks since Yahoo rebuffed Microsoft's takeover bid.2010 - Microsoft releases its Windows Phone operating system for mobile phones, trying to claw its way into the smartphone market and woo consumers away from Apple's iPhone and Google's Andriod devices.2011 - In February, Nokia and Microsoft strike a deal, in a bid to take on the smartphone market. By 2013, the partnership has yet to produce a product that has taken market share from Google and Apple.2012 - Microsoft, hoping for a hit, launches Surface tablets and its Windows 8 operating system that uses touch commands. The devices do not gain much market share in the tablet market, dominated by Apple's iPad and Samsung's Galaxy mobile devices.2013 - On August 23, Ballmer announces he will step down within 12 months, surprising industry watchers.

"content": " Stocks kicked off the week with a thud, with the Dow and S&P 500 logging their first four-day losing streaks this year, as Treasury yields hit a two-year high amid ongoing worries over when the Federal Reserve might start to reduce its asset purchases. 'All of last week, people were trying to make the story match the market move,' said Art Hogan, managing director at Lazard Capital. 'If the pullback last week was due to tapering worries, then I think we may have overdone it. I was more concerned about the actual negative newsweak guidance from Cisco and earnings misses from Macy's, Wal-Mart and Kohl's.' Name Price Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 70.73 points to finish at 15,010.74, closing near the psychologically-important 15,000 level, dragged by JPMorgan and Alcoa. Last week, the index suffered its worst weekly decline of 2013, shedding 2.2 percent. The S&P 500 fell 9.77 points to close at 1,646.06. And the Nasdaq declined 13.69 points to close at 3,589.09. The Dow and S&P 500 are on track for their biggest monthly declines since May 2012. The CBOE Volatility Index , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, jumped above 15. Most key S&P sectors finished in the red, led by energy and financials. Major averages slip to start week Monday, 19 Aug 2013 | 3:50 PM ET The Dow and S&P 500 are at the lows of the session. Brian Belski, BMO Capital Markets, and Chris Hyzy, U.S Trust join to discuss what it will take to get back into positive territory. 'The movement in the market is a bit exaggerated when volume is light and that's going to be the case over the next couple of weeks,' said Hogan. 'We don't have much this week but we do have a real concentration of information on Wednesday and Thursday including the Fed's meeting minutesuntil we get some news in terms of what tapering is going to look like, we may be sideways this week.' With no major economic data on tap Monday, trading will likely be light as investors look ahead to the minutes of the last Fed meeting, which will be released on Wednesday, for clues as to when the central bank will start scaling back its $85 billion per month stimulus program. In Asia, China's benchmark index, the Shanghai Composite, climbed 0.8 percent as sentiment recovered, following last week's trading error at Everbright Securities. Plus, the Japanese Nikkei reversed earlier losses after posting a wider-than-expected monthly trade deficit, which cast some doubt on Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's aggressive economic policies. On the earnings front, Saks slipped after the upscale department-store chain posted a winder-than-expected quarterly loss after weak sales. Saks became the latest retailer to post lackluster sales. Last week, Macy's, Nordstrom, Kohl's and Wal-Martall posted lower-than-expected sales. In July, Saks reached a deal to be acquired by Canada's Hudson's Bay. Urban Outfitters and Bob Evans are schedule to post results after the closing bell. Intel rallied after Piper Jaffray lifted its rating on the semiconductor company to 'neutral' from 'underweight' and raised its price target to $22 from $20. Google ticked higher on the ninth anniversary of its IPO. The search-engine giant's stock has skyrocketed an impressive 900 percent since going public in 2004 at $85 apiece. Only nine other stocks have outperformed Google in the last nine years. Priceline, Apple, Netflix and Salesforce are among notable names. JPMorgan Chase declined following weekend reports that U.S. authorities have opened a bribery investigation into whether the bank hired the children of Chinese officials to help it win lucrative business. Are markets complacent about tapering? Michael Gallagher, director of research at IDEAglobal, discusses the U.S. Treasurys market and how the rally in yield is a 'wake up call'. In the bond markets, yields on 10-year benchmark Treasurys briefly touched 2.90 percent, the highest since July 2011 amid Fed tapering concerns. So far this month, U.S. bond mutual funds and ETFs have seen outflows of $19.7 billion, according to TrimTabs. 'Heavy bond fund redemptions and the backup in bond yields should concern all investors, not just bond investors, because the U.S. economy is a highly leveraged economy that will not easily tolerate higher borrowing costs,' TrimTabs CEO David Santschi said in a report. Most homebuilders traded in the red, dragged by KBHome and Beazer. Oil prices reversed their gains to close slightly lower but unrest in Egypt and the loss of Libyan oil exports put a limit on losses. Oil prices are likely to drift higher this week, CNBC's weekly sentiment survey showed. However, price gains may be limited, as analysts said the uptick in political instability in Egypt had already been priced in. 'There is still too much oil,' said Thomas McMahon, director of the Pan Asia Clearing Enterprise and former chief executive officer of the Singapore Mercantile Exchange. 'But cheap dollars, technical disconnect and Egypt seems to be sweeping this aside. Common sense and supply demand will prevail but maybe not this week.'

Monday, 19 Aug 2013 | 5:20 PM ET On the ninth anniversary of Google's initial public offering, the CNBC 'Fast Money' traders weigh in on how they're trading the stock. Nine years after its initial public offering and a 900 percent gain over that period, Google still has bright days ahead, Stuart Frankel's Steve Grasso said Monday. 'I'm still a believer in Google. I still love it,' he said. 'It's probably my all-time favorite trade.' On CNBC's 'Fast Money,' Grasso also said that while he remained long, he had taken profits and sold two-thirds of his position in Google, looking to buy it back on a dip. Apple, Grasso said, was a different story. 'The only problem with Apple is that it's become a buyback story,' he added. Fast Forward: Home Depot & Best Buy Home Depot and Best Buy will report earnings on Tuesday. The 'Fast Money' traders take their positions. That suited James Lebenthal of Lebenthal Asset Management just fine. 'I think Apple is where Google was two years ago before the 30 percent run-up,' he said. 'Google may still have another 15 percent. 'Hey, Google may still have another 15 percent. I don't know. But I'm more certain that Apple has 15 percent.' Josh Brown of Fusion Analytics said that he thought the market was going to take Google stock higher. 'I don't love any stock,' he said. 'The market is voting as we speak.' Brown noted that Google has been growing at about 18 percent a year and called its stock price 'perfectly reasonable. 'I can't imagine this stock not getting to $1,000, barring any kind of market cataclysm,' he added. By CNBC's Bruno J. Navarro. Follow him on Twitter @Bruno_J_Navarro.

"content": " Check out which companies are making headlines before the bell on Tuesday: Home Depot The home improvement giant reported second quarter profit of $1.24 per share, beating estimates by three cents. Revenue was also above forecasts, and the home retailer also raised its sales and earnings estimates for the full year, reflecting the housing market's improvement. Best Buy The electronics retailer earned 32 cents per share for the second quarter, excluding certain items, beating estimates by 20 cents. Revenue also beat consensus, although the company does say second half results will be hurt by a number of factors including mobile warranty costs. Earnings Recap: BBY, JCP & HD CNBC's Courtney Reagan breaks down the numbers on retailers, Best Buy, JC Penney, and Home Depot, all reporting second quarter results this morning. J.C. Penney The retailer lost $1.17 per share for the second quarter, bigger than the $1.06 per share loss estimated by Thomson Reuters. Revenue was also below consensus, with Penney hurt by unusually high markdowns and failed prior merchandising and promotional strategies. Separately, Hayman Capital's Kyle Bass has taken a long position in the retailer's secured debt, according to Bloomberg. Dick's Sporting Goods The sporting goods retailer earned 71 cents per share for the second quarter, three cents shy of estimates. The company cites a 'sluggish consumer environment' and bad weather as factors in its quarterly results. Urban Outfitters The company reported second quarter profit of 51 cents per share, three cents above estimates. The teen apparel retailer's results were helped by fewer discounts and higher profit margins, even though revenue was slightly below Street forecasts. Nokia Bernstein is predicting a 'disastrous' September quarter for the handset maker, as it repeated an 'underperform' rating. The firm said Nokia's reliance on newly launched high end models is a 'risky bet'. Zynga Jefferies began coverage of the online gaming company with a 'sell' rating. Jefferies sees long term potential but said risks may come to the forefront sooner than new growth initiatives. JPMorgan Chase The Wall Street mega bank is the subject of a Justice Department investigation into energy market manipulation, according to Dow Jones. In July, the bank agreed to pay $410 million to settle similar allegations by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, although it did not admit to wrongdoing in that case. BHP Billiton BHP reported second half profit that missed analyst forecasts after falling 15 percent from a year earlier, and its new CEO Andrew Mackenzie is also planning a less ambitious expansion into the potash market than previously planned. Ann The retailer's shares were upgraded to 'buy' from 'neutral' at Janney, which points to improved product offerings and an attractive valuation. Tesla The automaker's model S received the highest safety rating ever issued by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Southwest Airlines The airline is being challenged in some of its markets by Allegiant Air, a smaller airline which has announced a new expansion into some East Coast markets served by Southwest. Electronic Arts EA tells Reuters it expects a boost from new gaming consoles being released by Sony and Microsoft later this year. Chief operating officer Peter Moore said the company sees growth even for physical boxed games, a segment that has generally declined as customers switch to online and mobile gaming. AOL The Internet portal has won dismissal of a lawsuit that accused both the company and some executives of fraud. The case stemmed from a share buyback, and the subsequent $1 billion sale of a patent portfolio to Microsoft that resulted in a 43 percent single-day surge in AOL's stock. Apple Apple has hired fitness industry consultant Jay Blahnik, according to All Things D. Blahnik was a key developer of Nike's FuelBand activity tracking device. By CNBC's Peter Schacknow Questions?

Warren Gilman, chairman and CEO of CEF Holdings, comments on results from Glencore Xstrata and BHP Billiton following Glencore's merger with Xstrata and the challenges that they're facing. European mining stocks took a hit on Tuesday after disappointing earnings from BHP Billiton and Glencore Xstrata.

The company also said sales trend had improved every month in the quarter. Shares traded higher. Best Buy surged after the consumer electronics retailer easily topped Wall Street expectations.

"title": "Smartphones: Why one size doesn't fit all anymore", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Getty Images Whether it's huge screens, miniscreens, flashy colors or novel features, smartphone vendors are making a huge effort to stand out in the sea of devices available on the market. But while all the specs and fancy functions may look impressive on paper, it doesn't necessarily mean consumers will bite. Here's a look at what smartphone trends analysts say will actually stick when it comes to mass market adoption. One size does not fit all Source: YouTube Samsung Galaxy Mega Samsung's latest phone, the Galaxy Mega, is the latest example of trying to stand out. The smartphone, which launches Friday on AT&T for $150, measures 6.3 inches diagonally, making it almost as big as a 7-inch tablet. Samsung says that the new Mega is meant to work as a hybrid between a phone and a tablet so that consumers don't have to buy two products. However, the size of the phone may be more of a joke to consumers instead of a practical device. 'It's becoming a little silly,' said Carolina Milanesi, a vice president of research on Gartner's consumer devices team. 'It seems to me these companies are doing it just for sake of doing it.' Huawei rolled out its 6.1-inch Ascend Mate smartphone earlier this year, so Samsung had to play catch-up to that, she said. 'Five inches use to be the best size and then 5 inch became the norm and so companies felt like they needed to go up, and if you do 5.5-inch screen, people are going to catch up to you very quickly. So they jumped to the 6 inches,' she said. But with the phones entering the 6-inch range, the line between phone and tablet becomes blurred. Vendors, though, argue the large size solves the problem of having to carry two different devicesa tablet and a smartphoneat the same time. And while this may be a solution for some consumers, it's really not a problem most people have. While there is a growing number of tablet users, most of them only use their tablet at home, Milanesi said. In addition, most people still a want something they can fit in their pocket while they're on the go, which is why she said she doesn't see these extra large smartphones having mass appeal. 'I've always been a skeptic about very large screen smartphones,' Milanesi said. 'As much as you want people thinking they are getting one device with everything, it's still not quite practical. And as prices on 7-inch tablets continue to [get] lower, you will have more consumers who can afford both so they will buy both.' But there is definitely a market for the large-screen phones, said Charles Golvin, a principal analyst at Forrester Research. While the sweet spot for a smartphone size remains 4-5 inches, there's a segmented group of consumers who will prefer a bigger device, he said. 'You can't just have a one size fits all. Now people have a lot more choice, they have a lot more experience, they know what they like, and what they don't like. For some people, bigger is better; they like the bigger screen,' Golvin said. 'They are definitely not mainstream; most people want something that is more pocketable than that. ... [But] they are still selling.' While Samsung is going big, HTC is going smaller. The HTC One Mini, which also launches Friday on AT&T for $99.99 with a two-year contract, features a 4.3-inch screen, making it slightly smaller than the full size version's 4.7 inches. However, while the Mini may be smaller than some of its competitors, it's still about the same size as an iPhone 5, which has a 4-inch display screen. 'When the HTC Mini was announced, it made me smile to see something that's 4.3-inches considered a mini, 2.6-inch was once considered a mini,' Milanesi said. 'If you go back a few years ago, Ericsson had a 2.6-inch mini. It was incredibly small. We haven't had 2.6-inch screen for years now, and now 4.3-inch is not that small.' Gold iPhones and other customization Getty Images Motorola's Moto X In addition to custom sizes, consumers are also becoming more concerned about being in control of how their phone looks, sounds and how they interact with their device, Golvin said. 'Personalization is clearly a continuing trend in this space. The smartphone is the most personal device people carry with them. There is this need for consumers to standout among their peers,' Golvin said. A big way vendors are trying to appeal to consumers when it comes to customization is by giving them more control of the color. Google-owned Motorola Mobility, for example, introduced a variety of color options for the casing of its new Moto X. The HTC One comes in red and is rumored to also come in blue soon. And the latest Nokia Lumia Windows Phone comes in yellow, in addition to the usual black and white. Apple may soon also be getting in on the color game with its new iPhone, which is expected to launch this fall. According to a TechCrunch report Monday, Apple will likely roll out its next generation iPhone with a new color option when it reveals its iPhone 5S this autumn. The company is planning to introduce the new phone in a shade of gold, similar to a champagne color, according to the report. Golvin said while he's not sure Apple will roll out a gold colored iPhone, he does think the company will introduce a new color soon. 'It's not a matter of if Apple will add more colors, but it's really a matter of when ... and what is that color going to be,' Golvin said. 'If you look at the competition and what they are offering, it's reasonable to say that Apple has reached the end of the line of just offering black and white.' New features aren't just gimmicks New iPhone on the way? AllThingsD reported that Apple is expected to unveil its next smartphone at a special event on Sept. 10, reports the 'Squawk on the Street' crew. Along with the display screen size personalization options, smartphone vendors are also experimenting with new ways for consumers to interact with their devices. 'One of the challenges all smartphone makers face today is that there aren't that many areas in hardware where these companies can distinguish themselves,' Golvin said. 'There's size and pixel density, color depth, but realistically there are only a few screen suppliers out there and they all use them. ... What that leaves is software innovations.' Some of the software innovations gaining traction among smartphone makers are voice-controlled commands and gesture-controlled navigation. These functions make smartphones more convenient to use and shouldn't be considered gimmicks, Golvin said. 'As new capabilities come into these devices, there is a cycle of forcing a change in customer behavior and how they use them,' Golvin said. These functions are similar to how the touchscreen was perceived when it first came out, he said. Many people weren't sure if consumers would adopt the technology, but eventually it became embedded in consumer behavior, he said. However, it's worth noting that voice-control commands, like the Google Now feature on Motorola Mobility's Moto X and Apple's Siri on the iPhone, are moving into the mainstream more so than gesture control functionality, Golvin said.

TiVo, a company known for popularizing DVR capabilities for cable subscribers, is redefining itself with Roamio, a new product aimed at giving users access to all their media content on multiple devices, in addition to recorded programs. Roamio 'takes TiVo and puts it out there in a way that people can truly understand. It is so much more than the DVR we were originally known for,' said Tom Rogers, TiVo president and CEO on 'Squawk on the Street' Tuesday. 'That revolutionized TV. We're out to revolutionize it again.' Rogers described Roamio as a combination of products already in the marketplace, including Apple TV, Google TV, Roku and Slingbox, as well as television and DVR services offered by cable operators. 'They take pieces of the streaming world and get it to your TV,' he said. Roamio will let users search and access Netflix, Amazon, Hulu and other streaming services, as well as their recorded shows, and other Internet content, including YouTube and streaming music services. Eventually, Rogers said, users will be able to access recorded content on mobile devices. 'It's the one comprehensive solution out there,' he added. The move is effectively a move toward cable operators, which have the best access points for content via broadband services, Rogers said.'We've made a bet on cable being the winners, and now we have a way for cable subscribers to have the best possible experience out there,' he said.

"content": " Stocks eased off their highs in the final minutes of trading to close narrowly mixed Tuesday, with the Dow logging its fifth-straight day lower. But losses were limited as handful of retailers and as bond yields receded from two-year highs. Investors also awaited further indications over the timing of the Federal Reserve's widely expected reduction in asset purchases. Name Price Change %Change DJIA --- S&P 500 --- NASDAQ --- The Dow Jones Industrial Average turned lower in the final minutes of trading. The index closed down 7.75 points to end at 15,002.99, logging its fifth-straight losing streak. Home Depot led the blue-chip laggards. The S&P 500 gained 6.29 points to end at 1,652.35. And the Nasdaq rose 24.50 points to finish at 3,613.59. . The CBOE Volatility Index , widely considered the best gauge of fear in the market, finished below 15. The Dow and S&P 500 are on pace for their worst month since May 2012. Among key S&P sectors, consumer discretionary and financials led the gainers, while consumer staples finished slightly lower. Closing Bell Exchange With tapering looming, Tom Karsten, Karsten Advisors; Bill Stone, PNC Asset Management Group; Vince Lowry, Revenue Shares; and CNBC's Rick Santelli provide insight on the markets going into the fall. With no major economic news, investors have been focusing on when the Federal Reserve will start scaling back stimulus effort. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note slipped near 2.83 percent after hitting a fresh two-year high of 2.90 percent on Monday. 'If you buy bond funds now, you're guaranteed to lose money whereas if you buy stocks, you still have a chance to make money,' said Dan Veru, CIO of Palisade Capital Management. 'We're going through this adjustment period of rates coming back up and that process can sometimes create headwinds for the market. And given we had no significant pullbacks for the market this year, we could be vulnerable to some setbacks.' Global markets took a hit from worries about reduced Fed stimulus. European markets were lower across the board. In Asia, emerging market stocks extended their sharp losses. Indonesia's Jakarta Composite fell nearly 5 percent, placing it in bear market territory, having lost approximately 22 percent from May's all-time record high. And Thailand's benchmark SET Index dropped nearly 3 percent. Japan's Nikkei closed at a near two-month low and China's Shanghai Composite fell 0.6 percent. 'The market did an excellent job of ignoring the overseas market damage this morning,' wrote Elliot Spar, market strategist at Stifel Nicolaus. 'If the market can have strong close today, my upside target is the gap at 1,685 on the S&P. We really don't want to get there too fast. Many damaged sectors and names need time to repair themselves. A rally in the S&P back to the recent high at 1,709 that is accompanied by numerous negative divergences would not be healthy for the market.' Best sector for the next decade? Mark Tepper, Strategic Wealth Partners, and Robert Luna, SureVest Capital Management, share their picks for the best sector over the next 10 years. Meanwhile, several retailers bucked the recent downbeat earnings trend. Best Buy surged to lead the S&P 500 gainers after the consumer electronics retailer easily topped Wall Street expectations. Urban Outfitters soared after the specialty retailer posted earnings that beat expectations. At least four brokerages lifted their price targets on the company. JCPenney posted sales that continued to fall sharply last quarter, but the troubled retailer said the back-to-school season has so far been 'encouraging.' The company also said sales trend had improved every month in the quarter. Shares traded higher. And Dow component Home Depot posted second quarter earnings that topped expectations and raise its full-year guidance, citing the rebounding housing market. Analog Devices and Intuit are among notable companies scheduled to post earnings after the closing bell. Apple dipped after S&P Capital IQ downgraded the iPhone maker to 'buy' from 'strong buy.' S&P Capital IQ equity analyst Scott Kessler said the stock was nearing his target price of $550, and noted that it had already risen 30 percent off a low set on June 27. Sony will release its PlayStation 4 console on November 15 in North America. The company said pre-orders for the new console has already exceeded one million.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " iLexx | E+ | Getty Images Stickers used in messaging applications are delivering healthy revenues for Asian technology firms, and as the craze starts to sweep the Western world, more companies are looking for a slice of the cash.The stickers, otherwise known as emojis are more advanced siblings of emoticons and have been a firm part of Japanese tech culture for the last ten years. After spreading first to the rest of Asia, they are now reaching the Western world, boosted by Apple's inclusion of them in its iOS5 software. Stickers can be anything from simple smileys to dancing pandas, and can express a range of emotions. Their global acceptance was underlined last week with the release of pop star Katy Perry's latest music video, which heavily featured the colorful images. But behind the cuteness lies cash. Japanese company Line, credited as one of the first companies to monetize the trend, announced core revenue of 9.77 billion yen in its second quarter. Sticker purchases made up 27 percent of revenue, and the company hopes to have 300 million subscribers by the end of the year. In a press conference on Tuesday, Line revealed there have been over 7 billion messages and 1 billion stickers sent as of August 2013, according to industry blog SD Japan. Korean rival, Kakao Talk, is having a similar boom. Its mobile games service generated 348 billion Won in revenue during the first half of 2013. 'You can see how many tens of millions they are doing every quarter, it's very profitable,' Riku Salminen, CEO of Jongla, a Finnish messaging app provider, told CNBC. Jongla launched its first messaging app last year, after the company was established in 2009. Salminen has instituted the 'Jongla Way' at the firm, using local content from local illustrators around the globe, who create graphics suited to separate cultures. The firm's instant messaging app is free to download, and 50 percent of the stickers are free. But the 50 percent that aren't free drive nearly all of the company's revenues, despite selling for less than two dollars per pack. Here's what's trending on CNBC.com The Asia Squawk Box team takes you through the latest top stories on CNBC.com. Fledgling U.S. startup Messageme has also jumped on the bandwagon, as too has Facebook, which has started offering an array of free emojis and has integrated a 'sticker store'. Tessa Mansfield, senior vice president at research firm Stylus, said that from a marketing perspective, the stickers were best used in promotions and merchandising, linked in with a new movie release or pop song. 'The rise of stickers and emoticons is absolutely rooted in the ubiquity of the modern smartphone, and the emergence of a tech-literate generation of teenagers,' she told CNBC. 'This fun, quirky communication method has developed as a kind of 'digital slang' for young teens, delivering the rapid, image-led messaging mirrored in apps such as Snapchat. It also appeals to the desire to collect and accumulate - allowing teens to curate individual collections of special edition and celebrity-led stickers to personalize their digital conversations.'

Beaten down over the spring and summer, shares of Apple have upside potential in both the near- and long-term, Steve Milunovich of UBS said Wednesday. 'Apple's like a fighter that's been taking punch after punch over the spring and summer, and finally it's going to start fighting back,' he said. 'I think psychologically this stock could go higher.' Milunovich raised his Apple price target to $560 per share from $500 and kept his 'buy' rating on the stock, largely on the expected strength of the iPhone 5C, the lower-cost version of its wildly popular smartphone. On CNBC's 'Fast Money,' he said that Apple was expected to ship 17 million iPhone units in fiscal 2014, with Asia's telecom behemoth China Mobile accounting for 10 percent of that total. 'We're assuming most of those will be the 5C, the lower-end phone,' he said. 'And we believe in general there's maybe 100 million people in China that can afford an Apple phone.' A deal with China Mobile could come by the end of 2013, Milunovich added. Halftime Pops & Drops Insight on stocks making the biggest moves in the market today, with the Fast Money traders. That, along with new products set to be unveiled next month, would create a short-term boost for the stock and a stronger long-term product. 'I think the stock has a lot of wood to chop to get back toward that $700 level. You need to believe earnings are going to be $50 plus, not that far away. We're now at about $48 for fiscal '15,' he said. 'Directionally, we do want to stay in the game. This is the time to own the stock, when you've got new products coming out. People are a bit skeptical. We think that this is a time to begin to buy Apple.' Milunovich also weighed in on activist investor Carl Icahn's big bet on Apple, saying that his holdings amounted to less than 1 percent of outstanding shares. 'Apple's relatively recently announced a $60 billion buyback. But the point is that they clearly do more,' he said. 'We believe that they could easily increase their buyback by 50 percent, which would be accretive to earnings by about $2 per year. I just don't think having done something recently the company's going to feel the need to do more.' By CNBC's Bruno J. Navarro. Follow him on Twitter @Bruno_J_Navarro.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Getty Images Oh, how the mighty have fallen. ExxonMobil, the world's largest oil and gas concern, has seen its stock close in negative territory in 19 of the past 20 sessions. Since scaling to a five-year high of $95.45 in July, it's been all downhill since then as the stock has tumbled 9 percent. Exxon's steep slide has cost investors in more ways than one. The oil big was once the world's most valuable company in terms of its market capitalization. Now, at $382 billion, Exxon's market capitalization is well behind technology giant Apple, which enjoys a market cap of about $458 billion. Over the past 20 sessions, the energy giant has become the worst-performing component of the 30 blue-chip stocks that comprise the Dow Jones industrial average. ExxonMobil: Biggest loser in the Dow 'Fast Money' traders Joe Terranova and Stephanie Link debate whether ExxonMobil is still a buy as its earnings dropped 57 percent from last year. And Paul Sankey of Deutsche Bank explains why he is 'very much on the sidelines of Exxon.' Exxon's point impact on the Dow over that period is second only to Chevron, the world's second-largest oil company: XOM has shaved approximately 52 points off the Dow while CVX has sliced more than 60 points off the index. Together, Exxon and Chevron accounted for 25 percent of the Dow's 565-point decline over the past 20 sessions. Although the U.S. is in the midst of an oil and gas renaissance that is transforming energy markets worldwide, that boom is largely dominated by small and midsize companies. By CNBC's Javier E.

Mike Vogelzang, Boston Advisors; and Mark Martiak, Premier Financial Advisors, take a look at sectors that have been the best performers over the years including energy. They also pick sectors that will shine years from now. Minutes from the Federal Reserve's latest policy meeting showed almost all the policymakers on the central bank's Federal Open Market Committee agreed that a change to the stimulus was not yet appropriate, though some hesitation remained. 'The Fed must be feeling significant political and global pressure to begin tapering because their language described in today's minutes release does not correspond to the current macro economic climate of the country,' wrote Todd Schoenberger, managing partner at LandColt Capital. 'Bottom line: Wall Street traders are angry and confused by today's release.' Benchmark 10-year Treasury note yields hit a fresh session high of 2.895 percent following the minutes.

Among earnings, Target declined after the retail giant warned its annual earnings will likely be near the lower end of its previous forecast as the company anticipates ongoing cautious consumer spending. Staples plunged to lead the S&P 500 laggards after the office supplies retailer posted earnings and revenue that missed projections, citing weakness in its retail stores and international operations. American Eagle Outfitters dropped sharply after the teen apparel retailer issued disappointing guidance for the crucial back-to-school quarter. Additionally, the company said same-store sales will drop by a mid-to-high single digit percentage in the current quarter. Rivals Abercrombie & Fitch and Aeropostale also declined. Meanwhile, Lowe's rallied to lead the S&P 500 gainers after the home-improvement company topped quarterly expectations and boosted its full-year outlook. The news came a day after rival Home Depot posted strong earnings results. Hewlett-Packard edged lower after the company reassigned Dave Donatelli, the executive vice president in charge of the firm's enterprise group to a new role. Donatelli's new role will be announced when the company posts its quarterly results after the closing bell. L Brands, parent company of Victoria's Secret, is also slated to post earnings after the closing bell. Apple climbed, bucking the downward trend of the broader markets, after UBS raised its price target on the iPhone maker to $560 from $500. Goldman Sachs experienced a glitch on Tuesday that resulted in a large number of erroneous single stock and ETF options trades. Many of the trades may wind up being erased, but the error could still cost the firm over $100 million, according to a person familiar with the situation. On the economic front, existing home sales jumped 6.5 percent in July to an annualized rate of 5.39 million, according to the National Association of Realtors. Economists in a Reuters survey expected a total of 5.15 million annualized units versus 5.08 million annualized units in June.

Then let's look behind the scenes at the intensifying battle to fill Ben Bernanke's $3.6 trillion shoes. Larry Summers and Janet Yellen are duking it out, as the WaPo details. Big business is a cutthroat world where sometimes the only rationale for doing something is to hurt the other guy. That may be the case with Apple's iTunes Radio, which Minyanville thinks is just for 'keeping its users from other Internet radio products.' When all was said and done, the prosecution of Bradley Manning for funneling confidential documents to WikiLeaks was 'a colossal waste of time,' according to Time. Despite the 35-year sentence, Manning, 25, could be in his 30s by the time he gets out of prison, making him ripe to have his own intelligence-leaking reality show. Well, as if you didn't know: Even with the supposedly anemic inflation level we've seen since the end of the Great Recession, most Americans have less buying power now than they did four years ago. The Fed's likely reversal of its monetary easing is kicking the heck out of emerging market currencies and economies. Here's what tapering looks like from abroad.

Charles Golvin, a principal analyst at Forrester Research, told CNBC earlier this week that while he is not sure Apple will roll out a gold iPhone, the company will eventually have to begin to include color into its iPhone line. 'It's not a matter of if Apple will add more colors, but it's really a matter of when ... and what is that color going to be,' Golvin said.

Paul Hickey, Bespoke; and CNBC contributor Herb Greenberg, weigh in on Nasdaq's handling of alerts. 3:52 PM is the updated time for trade resumption. Global data encouraging, Fed fears linger Economic data is what drove markets on Thursday. The latest jobless claims report showed a rise in initial claims to 336,000, a bit higher than the 330,000 economists were looking for. July leading indicators were better than expected and Markit's 'flash' U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers index posted its best showing since March. 'I do think the economy is in better shape than most people think, and that's why I think this setback over the last few days is a buying opportunity,' Jim McCaughan of Principal Global Investors said. In global economic data, HSBC's preliminary reading of Chinese PMI for August crossed the key 50-level for the first time in four months thanks to a rebound in new orders, pointing to potential stabilization. 'China's manufacturing growth has started to stabilize on the back of modest improvements in new business and output. This is mainly driven by the initial filtering through of recent fine-tuning measures and companies' restocking activities,' said Qu Hongbin, the co-head of Asian economic research at HSBC. European markets closed higher after Germany's PMI for August climbed in July. Broader euro zone PMI data also beat expectations. 'They're certainly good numbers, and we've been seeing this for the last four or five months in Europe,' Richard Jerram, chief economist at the Bank of Singapore, told CNBC.

Economy in better shape than people think: Expert Jim McCaughan, Principal Global Investors CEO, explains why he thinks the U.S. economy is improving. There remains ongoing uncertainty as to when the Fed will start tapering its massive stimulus program, however. Minutes from the central bank's last policy meeting, released on Wednesday, showed the Fed is preparing to start tapering, but provided little indication as to when it might do so. UBS economist Maury Harris told CNBC, 'The Fed is just apparently unable to send any kind of consistent message about what they're up to.' Harris expects tapering to start in the fourth quarter, but it could be a 'tiny taper' and 'hardly enough to make any kind of difference.'

According to Nasdaq, the problem 'led to a degradation in the ability of the SIP to disseminate consolidated quotes and trades.' Nasdaq did not identify which exchange had the issue connecting with the Securities Information Processor, also known as SIP. In its statement, it did say the 'cause of the issue has been identified and addressed.' Nasdaq: Identified & addressed 'connectivity issue' CNBC's Josh Lipton reports the Nasdaq has identified and addressed a connectivity issue in regards to today's trading glitch. Nasdaq said once it became aware of the problem, it halted trading in all Nasdaq-listed securities to 'protect the integrity of the markets.' The SIP's technical issues were resolved in the first 30 minutes, Nasdaq added. The remaining time was needed to coordinate with other exchanges, regulators and market participants for an 'orderly re-opening' of trading. Trading resumed at 3:25 pm ET after the longest shutdown at the exchange in recent memory. It halted trading in such high-profile companies such as Apple, Microsoft and Facebook. Despite the freeze, Nasdaq said that it would not cancel orders. SEC Chair Mary Jo White said in a separate statement the 'serious' interruption underlines the need to address 'technological vulnerabilities.' The exchange closed at its normal time of 4 pm ET. Despite the troubles, stocks closed slightly up for the day. There were reports Thursday morning that NYSE Euronext was telling traders its electronic exchange Arca was having technical issues with some Nasdaq-listed stocks. Nasdaq stopped routing orders to Arca temporarily, but reportedly the issues were resolved before Nasdaq halted all trading. Nasdaq officials would not comment when asked if the 'exchange participant' that had the 'connectivity issue' was Arca. The NYSE also had no comment. Once Nasdaq resumed trading, there were some technical issues when Arca went to reconnect, an NYSE spokesman said. He made the comment in response to a question before the latest Nasdaq statement. Nasdaq 'flash freeze' fallout A major technical glitch halted the Nasdaq this afternoon. The 'Fast Money' traders and CNBC's Bertha Coombs and Bob Pisani. The shutdown brought sometimes vehement criticism from across Wall Street. 'This is such an embarrassment to the entire financial community. To have the Nasdaq go down as it has; to be down three hoursit's one thing to be down for five minutesto be down for three hours is absolutely inexcusable,' said Dennis Gartman, editor and publisher of The Gartman Letter. 'It reminds me of sitting at the US Airways terminal and hearing nothing from nobody and you're getting angrier by the hour,' he said. Former SEC chairman Harvey Pitt told CNBC: 'It looked like Nasdaq was clueless about how to deal with this emergency.' 'Nasdaq has, in my view, serious issues and there are two particular problems here. The first is, is there technology up to the task. That's number one and then the second is, that when technology goes bad, do they have an established crisis management program?,' Pitt said. Within an hour of the shutdown starting, the Nasdaq options markets issued a 'system update' saying they were recommending firms route all open orders elsewhere. An average of 1.6 billion shares have been traded on the Nasdaq every day this August, according to statistics from Sandler O'Neill. Nasdaq: Halts trading in all tape C securities CNBC's Bob Pisani and Bertha Coombs report the Nasdaq has halted trading in options market as of 12:20p. The New York Stock Exchange halted trading in all Nasdaq securities at its request and canceled orders. The NYSE otherwise declined comment.

"content": " Getty Images Wall Street's latest trading fiasco is not expected to have a lingering impact on the market, but it certainly dealt a longer term blow to the Nasdaq's reputation. Trading in Nasdaq-listed stocks and options on those stocks were frozen for three hours Thursday, paralyzing a large cross section of the U.S. stock market. The financial hit to Nasdaq could be just several hundred thousand dollars in lost revenues, according to some analysts, but after its high-profile fumble trading the Facebook IPO, Nasdaq is under scrutiny, as is the entire market's vulnerability. Such a noticeable technology breakdown on Wall Street is also another blow to investor confidence, shaken by the financial crisis but also by high speed trading and trading debacles, like the 2010 'flash crash.' Nasdaq is home to such high profile tech names as Apple, Google, Amazon and Microsoft. Securities and Exchange Commissioner Mary Jo White weighed in Thursday evening, taking a hard tone. She said she would call a meeting of exchange leaders and other market participants and would push an SEC proposal for new standards for trading and other market systems. 'Today's interruption in trading, while resolved before the end of the day, was nonetheless serious and should reinforce our collective commitment to addressing technological vulnerabilities of exchanges and other market participants.' In the last several years, there have been a series of computer-related trading calamaties, including the most dramatic the 'flash crash,' which sent the Dow into a rapid 1000 point decline, before it recovered. Glitches and failures large and small have occurred across the industry. The CBOE had a delayed opening in April for internal systems issues, and BATS Global Markets last year experienced a software glitch so severe that it canceled its IPO. A flawed Goldman Sachs computer system just this week generated a large amount of erroneous options trades. This latest snafu, which occurred just after noon Thursday, was resolved within a half hour, according to Nasdaq, but it took the remaining time to coordinate with other exchanges, regulators and market participants to ensure the orderly re-opening of trading, Nasdaq said. Traders complained that they received little information from Nasdaq while they waited for it to reopen. 'It's just frustrating. You can't get any answer from Nasdaq as to what actually happened,' said Andy Stein, head of equity trading at Cowen, just after trading resumed at about 3:25 p.m. 'We have concern for any international orders we were working over the day.' Trading was slow once the market reopened. 'I think a lot of people stayed on the sidelines after they reopened the market,' Stein said. Steve Massocca of Wedbush Securities said the failure of exchange technology unfortunately is a trend that could continue. 'I just see it as part of the foreseeable future. I don't see it change. This is a recurring theme. These automated systems have issues on occasion,' he said. Death by regulations?

Also, Stemberg answers whether a company like Staples could have been built in 2013. The Nasdaq index was higher when the halt occurred and closed 38 points higher at 3638. The stock of exchange parent Nasdaq OMX stock wasn't so lucky, losing 3.4 percent on the day. The S&P was up 14 points at 1656, just above its 50-day moving average, and the Dow was up 66 at 14,963. Nasdaq said it halted trading after it became aware price quotes were not being disseminated by the Securities Industry Processor, basically a quote disseminator. Nasdaq is the operator of the SIP for the industry on its listed issues, while the NYSE operates SIPs for its stocks and ETFs. 'If it was a Nasdaq problem with a Nasdaq system, the other exchanges could have kept trading the four-letter symbols but because the industry tape uses price dissemination and Nasdaq operates it, they called a regulatory halt,' said Richard Repetto, analyst with Sandler O'Neill. 'One interesting thing, it's not because the market is all fragmented. it's the one system that's not fragmented.' In the early evening Thursday, Nasdaq followed up with another statement, this time pointing to issues between an exchange participant and the SIP. 'There was a connectivity issue between an exchange participant and the SIP, which lead to a degradation in the ability of the SIP to disseminate consolidated quotes and trades. The cause of the issue has been identified and addressed,' it said. Nasdaq officials declined to comment beyond the statement. Well before the Nasdaq halt, there were reports Thursday morning that NYSE Euronext was telling traders its electronic exchange Arca was having technical issues with some Nasdaq listed stocks. Nasdaq had stopped routing orders to Arca temporarily. But those issues were reportedly resolved before Nasdaq halted all trading. Once Nasdaq resumed trading, there were some technical issues when Arca went to reconnect, an NYSE spokesman said. He made the comment, in response to a question, before Nasdaq issued its statement. 'The difference between Facebook and now, and everything we know about this, it doesn't look like there's big direct damage,' said Repetto. 'They shut down and they shut the entire industry down and people knew their positions. the direct monetary damages look limited at the moment. Its brand, its reputation and the listing business could see other indirect effects. The amount of people suing them is going to be limited. They shut the whole market down and they allowed people when they came up to cancel their bids.' As for trading Friday, Scott Redler of T3live.com said stocks could attempt to press higher again. 'We closed higher than where we were before the halt. That tells me this oversold bounce can continue,' he said. 'For equities, it was almost like a yawner. It was ridiculous it took them three hours to get back up.' New home sales for July are reported at 10 a.m. ET. Traders will also be watching the Fed Friday, as officials meet for their annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyo. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will not be there, but other Fed officials are in attendance. By CNBC's Patti Domm. Follow here on Twitter @pattidomm. "

As the Nasdaq tries to figure out why it couldn't process trades for hours on Thursday, investors outside the exchange are trying to figure out what to name the event. Three years ago we had the Flash Crash. A year ago there was the Facebook Flub. But this? CNBC contributor Josh Brown suggests we call the meltdown 'The Flash Freeze,' because what started as a flash froze ... all afternoon. How hard could it be to fix the problem? As @apsduke tweeted, 'NASDAQ I.T. head just has to answer 'my first pet's name?' ' A lot of disgust from traders: Jeff Cox on Nasdaq Troy Gayeski of Skybridge Capital and CNBC's Jeff Cox provide commentary on activity after Nasdaq's trading halt. Perhaps the event deserves a name that encompasses all the problems in electronic trading recently. Even Hitler is shocked that such things could still happen in 2013. Yes, even before the shutdown was over, it had been parodied in the well-worn clip from 'Downfall.' Click here to watch it. This is a big deal. Trading in Apple stopped for three hours. No Apple for three hours. Panicked investors discovered for the first time that there are 499 other stocks in the S&P 500. So what to call it? I sought suggestions from Twitter and added a few of my own.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " U.S. stock index futures signaled a flat to higher open on Friday a day after trading in Nasdaq securities was halted for more than three hours. Nasdaq OMX Group CEO Robert Greifeld told CNBC that the exchange has fixed the technical issues that led to Thursday's trading halt, but cannot guarantee there would be no future problems.. Microsoft shares are surging in early trading after the company said its CEO Steve Ballmer will retire within 12 months. He will remain CEO until a successor is named. The board has formed a special committee to consider both internal and external candidates. The Federal Reserve will be in focus on Friday, with officials meeting for an annual symposium in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke will not be present, but traders will still listen for any indication of when the central bank might start tapering its $85 billion per month asset purchases. 'There is still some uncertainty as to whether the Fed will scale back QE3 [its third round of quantitative easing] in September or December, and how precisely tapering will be conducted,' said Capital Economics' Jessica Hinds, in a research note. Atlanta Fed president Dennis Lockhart told CNBC that the data needs to show 'sustainable' economic growth in order for the central bank to start cutting back on its monthly bond purchases. But he wouldn't rule out some sort of September move. James Bullard of the St. Louis Fed, meanwhile, told CNBC the central bank should take its time and assess the situation before reducing stimulus. 'Inflation is running low, you've got mixed data on the economy, so I'd be cautious and I wouldn't want to pre-judge the meeting,' he said. Data out on Thursday pointed to improvement in the global economy. U.S. PMI posted its best showing since March, while euro zone PMI data also beat expectations. Both followed China's HSBC PMI figure, which hit a four-month high in August. The data helped push U.S. shares to a higher close, despite the Nasdaq trading halt. On Friday, new home sales for July will be reported at 10 a.m. Any marked changes could move markets, as the Fed has said that its decision on when to start scaling back asset purchases will be based on U.S. economic indicators. Economists forecast a 1.4 percent drop to an annualized rate of 490,000 units in July, after an 8.3 percent rise in the previous month. Turning to earnings reports, Pandora Media shares were falling after the company warned that earnings for fiscal 2014 would fall below analyst estimates as expenses to buy music rights and expand its sales personnel rise. Retailers were also in focus again with solid results from Gap, Ann and Foot Locker and a weak print from Aeropostale. Other stocks to watch on Friday include Apple, after billionaire investor Carl Icahn tweeted that Apple CEO Tim Cook was planning a bigger buyback. Icahn revealed last week that he had taken a large position in Apple, which is estimated to be worth more than $1 billion. In addition, several images were leaked on Thursday of what appears to be Apple's new line of iPhones. Bank stocks will also be in focus, after Moody's Investors Service warned it might cut the credit ratings of the six biggest U.S. banks Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo saying the government may be unlikely to bail them out should they face trouble in the future.

"title": "After trading halt, what next for Nasdaq? ", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Adam Jeffery | CNBC A day after trading on the Nasdaq was halted for three hours, analysts say the stock exchange's credibility is likely to bear the brunt of the fall-out with the implications limited for broader trading in U.S. stocks. Nasdaq on Thursday said a 'connectivity issue between an exchange participant' had prompted it to stop trading. The trading halt was the longest shutdown at the exchange in recent memory, sparking confusion that impacted some of the biggest companies in the U.S. such as Apple and Facebook. Analysts say Nasdaq will now have to work hard to restore its reputation as a stock exchange operator, with Thursday's incident following trading problems with the initial public offering of Facebook in May last year. 'This is an issue about the Nasdaq and how it can it compete against other exchanges it comes on top of the Facebook issue a while back,' Peter Boockvar, chief market analyst at the consultancy The Lindsey Group, told CNBC Asia's 'Squawk Box.' 'If you're a company, you get to decide: do you want to list on the Nasdaq or the NYSE [New York Stock Exchange]? So from a competitive standpoint Nasdaq needs to do a lot of work to regain its reputation,' he added. What the Nasdaq freeze means for investors Peter Boockvar, Chief Market Analyst at The Lindsey Group explains why Thursday's 3 hour closure on the Nasdaq won't hurt the exchange operator's share price too badly. Shares of Nasdaq OMX, the company that operates the tech-heavy Nasdaq, fell to their lowest level since early May when trading on the exchange resumed on Thursday and closed more than 3 percent lower at $30.46. 'Clearly the NYSE should benefit from this, but the NYSE is not fool-proof either as that also relies more on technology. So the NYSE should benefit from a reputational standpoint, but they've also had problems from a technical standpoint,' Boockvar said. The trading glitch comes at a bad time for financial markets, where trade has been volatile in recent months as investors anticipate a potential pull-back in the U.S. Federal Reserve's asset-purchase program aimed at supporting the economy. 'The trading halt doesn't change our view on investing in the U.S. markets as we take a long-term view,' Alex Friedman, chief investment officer at UBS Wealth Management, told CNBC. 'What it does do is hurt sentiment when you need sentiment to be heading in a positive direction. These things [technical problems] do happen in markets, so I don't think it's as big a deal as it seems right now,' he added. U.S. markets closed higher on Thursday, with all three major stock indices holding onto their gains after the Nasdaq re-opened from the trading halt. Asian markets were generally higher on Friday, suggesting the Nasdaq trading halt had limited impact on broader market sentiment. 'Technical problems do happen. On a broader note, exchanges do need to look at how they can make trading more efficient,' said David Poh, regional head of asset allocation at Societe Generale Private Banking.

"content": " LOS ANGELES, Aug. 1, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- In today's complex global marketplace, the need for a truly masterful litigation attorney is clearer than ever. At the Los Angeles-based Adli Law Group, P.C., you'll find a team that includes an intellectual property attorney for nearly any company's patent, trademark and IP needs. Clients of the firm benefit from the world-class experience of founder Dr. Dariush Adli, Ph.D., Esq., who oversees a firm with impeccable skill in fields like patent, trademark, copyright, life sciences and entertainment law. That's why, for those seeking an entertainment lawyer that can also navigate the complexities of science and technology-related patents with efficiency and effectiveness, the legal counsel of Adli Law Group, P.C. is invaluable. When many entrepreneurs or inventors set out on achieving their goals, a common mistake is to assume ingenuity and ambition are enough to find success. While it's true that both those traits are necessary for any successful professional, the attorneys at Adli Law Group, P.C. know from firsthand experience that an expert knowledge of business law is also essential. No matter how effective or influential your company may be, without legal protection of one's ideas, logos and symbols, your company's products or message could be lost before ever reaching its intended audience. One recent case illustrating the complexities of patent and trademark law also deals with one of the most influential tech companies in the world today Apple Inc. This past spring, to the surprise of many, Apple was denied a patent for their iPad mini device. While the decision to grant Apple a trademark for their tablet device seemed clear after all, the iPad is already an iconic device for the renowned tech company. Yet, in a letter from the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, the tech giant was notified they would need to make it clear they seek only to trademark the term 'iPad mini' and not the actual word 'mini.' The disclaimer is designed to ensure that Apple won't attempt to deny other companies to use the descriptive term in the title of their own products. For a company with a reach as wide as Apple, the denial of their trademark request will likely serve as a minor hiccup, but for most companies, this delay could cause a great deal of stress and income lost. With the legal counsel of Adli Law Group, P.C., though, these sorts of crises can be handled efficiently and discreetly when they arise, or even before they come up at all. Many were surprised to see this trademark denial leveled at such a high-profile company but such is the nature of trademark, patent and business law. Fortunately for their many professional clients, Adli Law Group, P.C. recruits only the highest caliber attorneys in order to assist companies ranging from small start-ups to multi-national Fortune 500 companies in a variety of modern business concerns.

Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Amazon.com Inc. , Netflix Inc , Apple Inc. , Credit Suisse Group AG and The Blackstone Group L.P. . Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free. Here are highlights from Thursday's Analyst Blog: Amazon to Produce 5 Kids Shows Amazon.com Inc. announced that its film production division, Amazon Studios plans to produce pilots for 5 more original children shows in an effort to make its Prime Instant video service more attractive to its customers. These include Gortimer Gibbon's Life on Normal Street, a live-action adventure show, Grid Smasher, Hard-Boiled Eggheads, an animated action-comedy for the age group of 6-11, The Jo B. & G. Raff Show and an animated series, Wishenpoof!. Management stated that all 5 pilots will be available on the Amazon Instant Video streaming service where viewers can watch them free of cost. Amazon Studios will take a call on which shows to produce going forward depending on viewer feedback. Amazon Instant Video is a digital video streaming and download service that lets users rent, buy or subscribe to a range of video content. These pilots will further extend the archive of children shows on Amazon's video streaming library, making it a significant force in the video streaming segment and increasing competition for Netflix Inc and Apple Inc. . The completed pilots will be exclusively available to Prime members through Prime Instant Video and Lovefilm in the UK for no additional cost. Lovefilm is Amazon's European DVD and streaming movie service, which has almost 2 million subscribers. Recently, in June, Amazon had announced its decision to produce 5 original TV series from a group of 14 pilots that were earlier produced by its film production division, Amazon Studios. These 5 TV series, which include 2 comedy series and 3 children shows, will be available on the Amazon Instant Video streaming service later this year and in early 2014. In fact, many technology companies are getting into content production, including Hulu and Netflix, to reduce their reliance on traditional media companies. Amazon has been working on this for a while now and we believe these efforts will bring in millions of dollars and help the company to increase its market share. Amazon is one of the leading players in an extremely fast-growing market. In the second quarter, Amazon's top and bottom lines missed our expectations. The company is making huge investments in fulfillment and technology & content, which might continue to impact the company's bottom line going forward. Currently, Amazon shares retain a Zacks Rank #5 . Credit Suisse to Vend Private Equity Unit In an attempt to discard its non-core businesses, Credit Suisse Group AG plans to vend its private-equity unit Customized Fund Investment Group to Chicago-based Grosvenor Capital Management LP. The deal is expected to be announced at the end of the current week. The agreement is anticipated to be valued at an amount exceeding $200 million in the form of cash and other considerations that would comprise future payouts based on the performance of private-equity investments. Moreover, the agreement between Credit Suisse and Grosvenor Capital is yet to be finalized. Like other banks, Credit Suisse has been affected by the implementation of new rules on capital requirements and investment activities. This has compelled the bank to shed its non-core business units in order to conform by stricter rules for managing capital and risk. Credit Suisse's private equity unit manages revenue-generating client assets invested in third-party private equity funds and collects fees on these assets. At present, Credit Suisse manages revenue-generating assets worth $20 billion. Additionally, it has $10 billion in commitments and other assets. On the other hand, Grosvenor Capital, a privately owned investor in hedge funds, oversees client assets invested in hedge funds worth $23 billion. On successful completion of this transaction, Grosvenor Capital's client assets are expected to double in size, thereby expanding the company's business. Of late, Credit Suisse has been shedding its private-equity units that allocate money to hedge funds and other investment managers. Earlier in Apr 2013, Credit Suisse declared its intention to sell its secondary private equity business, Strategic Partners, to The Blackstone Group L.P. . The deal, which is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2013, is subject to customary closing conditions. Upon completion, the deal is expected to reduce Credit Suisse's expenses. Moreover, by discarding its non-core businesses, the company will be able to focus more on its core operations. Additionally, it would help the firm in fulfilling the stringent regulatory requirements. Credit Suisse currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 .

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " HOUSTON---- With Apple reportedly looking into acquiring a 3D printing company, Quantum International Corp. is well positioned for growth as it continues exploring the innovative three-dimensional printing technology for the manufacturing of its iPad case. 3D printing has gained momentum over the last 18 months as innovators discover the best ways to use the latest additive manufacturing technology to print everything from small toys to large buildings.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " CHICAGO, Aug. 5, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Google Inc. , Apple Inc , Earthlink , Facebook and Everest Re Group, Ltd. . Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free. Here are highlights from Friday's Analyst Blog: Google's First Smartphone: Moto X In order to gain traction in the hardware market, Google Inc.'s Motorola Mobility introduced its new smartphone, Moto X, which is expected to be released in the U.S. by the end of this month. Following the news, Google's share price surged 1.86%. Moto X is the first smartphone designed by Motorola since it was acquired by Google. Powered by its Android OS, Moto X will come with a 4.7 inch display, better screen resolution, a camera designed for a quick boot-up and a better battery life. Features in the Moto X include design customization options whereby users can personalize their handset with their choice of colors and materials. It also has a Touchless Control feature, which uses Google Voice to add voice-recognition capabilities and turns on the phone even without touching. The phone will cost $199 with a two-year contract and be available on all four major U.S. carriers and US Cellular. Google had bought Motorola for $12.5 billion in 2012 and stated that it would continue to run as a separate unit, with its phones based on the Android OS. The deal was the biggest in its 13-year history and propped up Google's portfolio with more than 17,000 patents. To Google's misfortune, Motorola has been continuously losing market share to its competitors and has been unable to regain it. In the last couple of years, the once-significant cell phone maker, Motorola Mobility, fell behind in the competitive smartphone market, which is now dominated by Apple Inc's iPhone and Samsung's Galaxy range, which runs on Google's Android platform. According to a report by research firm IDC, Android and Apple's iOS operating systems together held approximately 92.3% of smartphone market share in the first quarter of 2013. Moreover, Apple and Samsung together hold a 62.2% share of the U.S. smartphone market, while Motorola has a mere 7.8%, which was down 7.1% from the prior quarter. As a result, it becomes important for Motorola to introduce competitive products that can address the needs of its target market. We believe that the Moto X features position the phone at the lower end and expect Google to come up with better versions as time goes by.. At any rate, Motorola still has some way to go to retain its lost glory. Google is a market leader in online advertising and its mobile strategy has been bang on target so far. Its Android OS has gone a long way toward cementing its position in the mobile segment. However, the Motorola hardware segment has not done well. In the last quarter, the segment was down 2.0% sequentially and accounted for around 7% of revenues. Management did not say much about Motorola's future plans. Google currently carries a Zacks Rank #5 . Stocks that have been performing well in its sector and are worth considering include Earthlink and Facebook . While Earthlink carries a Zacks Rank #2 , Facebook carries a Zacks Rank #1 . Everest Re Ratings Affirmed Last week the rating agency, A.M. Best affirmed the issuer credit ratings of 'a-' of Everest Re Group, Ltd. . The company's debt ratings were also affirmed along with the ratings of its subsidiaries. All the ratings carry a Stable outlook. This rating affirmation indicates Everest Re's strong balance sheet profile and better-than-average underwriting performance, along with its ability to perform favorably amidst tough market conditions, a seasoned management team and huge market share in the insurance and reinsurance industry. Everest Re has adequate capital flexibility, which shields the company from market uncertainties. Moreover, its combined ratio, signifying an insurer's profitability, remained below the breakeven levels over the past decade. The company also has a liquid investment portfolio that has a short duration maturity. It has kept its investment portfolio conservative by investing just 10% of the total investment money in equities. A low incidence of equity in the investment portfolio will protect the company from equity market volatility. The company has also successfully increased its cash flows year-over- year. The rating agency noted that Everest is well-run by a seasoned and experienced management team, which has kept the company's operating costs under control and successfully delivered underwriting profitability year after year. The company is also well-diversified across different regions with a wide product portfolio, which helps it to garner a greater market share. The rating agency also praised Everest Re for managing its enterprise risk effectively over the years. The company's effective risk management capability has helped it to reduce risk across its business, and at the same time enabled it to allocate capital efficiently. Nevertheless, factors negating the positives include Everest Re's exposure to catastrophe losses, which impart volatility to its earnings. Though the company uses catastrophe models and has maintained risk limits to control catastrophe losses, occurrence of such incidents reduce the company's earnings. Everest Re also carries net asbestos and environmental exposure of approximately $426 million, which has been going down recently. Reserves against these policies are monitored on a quarterly basis and the current review shows that the company has adequate reserves against these liabilities. Going forward, the rating agency is likely to give a positive review to Everest Re's ratings if it continues to deliver consistent underwriting profitability as well as maintain strong capital profile. However, reduced profitability and capital levels, along with greater-than-expected exposure to catastrophe loss and declining capital reserves may compel the agency to provide a negative rating. Everest Re currently retains a Zacks Rank #2. Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.

The report, which was generated from findings of a survey taken by the AIIM community from May 10 to June 26, found that spending on mobile capture, optical character recognition , BPM/workflow and accounts payable/accounts receivable technologies is anticipated to increase sharply over the next 12 months. The survey evaluated the responses of 562 individual AIIM members to track companies' progress in going paper free, adoption of digital mailrooms and mobile capture, as well as show which processes are most effective for paper-free working. The final report measures specific improvement factors that can be used to build a business case for greater investment in the battle against paper and make recommendations on how to move the business forward.

'Our customers are looking to leverage these capabilities throughout their environments and business processes. We believe the market will not only see significant adoption of these technologies in traditional scanner, printer and MFP applications, but span mobile devices of all kinds to enable improved communications and information sharing both from within and outside the firewall.' The departments or areas within organizations that are most likely to be the focus of a capture enablement drive are HR , finance and any lines of business that deal with a heavy volume of forms, contracts or logistics documents. As evidenced by the survey, finance has demonstrated the most success with 70 percent of respondents qualifying the ROI as either 'excellent' or 'good.' Another area of focus in the drive for operational efficiency is the point at which documents enter the organization. According to the survey, 52 percent of organizations have a mail delivery requirement of four hours or less. Many enterprises are implementing a digital mailroom to automatically capture, classify and route documents through the business. Of the respondents whose organizations have a digital mailroom, 60 percent reported mail traceability and compliance improvements as the greatest benefit - followed closely by improved customer service and better quality of data capture into downstream processes.

"content": " MALVERN, Pa., Aug. 7, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Millions of U.S. workers attend meetings every day, generating tons of paper, risking valuable confidential information and squinting bleary eyes at conference room screens. Committed to a better meeting experience, Ricoh Americas Corporation today unveiled a new, paperless meeting approach that enables attendees to experience the presentation through their Apple iPad. With the RICOH Smart Presenter for iPad, the presenter controls the flow of content, automatically driving the experience on each participant's iPad. At any time, however, individual participants can zoom in, zoom out, go back or jump ahead in the presentation. Presenters can also hand off control of the meeting to any other user in the room. 'Although times have changed, meetings generally haven't until today,' said Jason Dizzine, Vice President, Technology Marketing, Ricoh Americas Corporation. 'RICOH Smart Presenter is a modern, entirely paperless way to collaborate that's far more satisfying than paging through paper presentations which often end up in the trash, or watching a single, central, monolithic conference room screen.

The RICOH Smart Presenter solution was put into service for a 100-participant meeting on emerging markets held in Tokyo, Japan in October 2012. In a survey of meeting participants, ninety-eight percent of the attendees agreed the technology made the workshop more effective, with everyone in agreement that it was easy to use. When configured with the RICOH Conference Center option, RICOH Smart Presenter enables presenters to upload supported documents, presentations and spreadsheets prior to a scheduled meeting. The RICOH Conference Center offers enhanced security with the uploaded files automatically converted into PDFs and then stored locally on the customer's server.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " ALEXANDRIA, Va., Aug. 6, 2013 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- In new videos and a game launched today on www.NSTeens.org, the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children and Sprint are challenging tweens to think about the choices they're making online. The new content added to the free Internet-safety site tackles issues like cyberbullying and online enticement. Its goal is to empower kids to be safer and smarter online. 'Recent studies have found that most children are using the Internet every day by age 8. As they get older the amount of time spent online will only increase,' said John Ryan, CEO of NCMEC. 'We have to help our kids understand, from a young age, that what they are doing online can have a lasting impact on their lives. Threats from potential predators are real, but kids also have to consider how they will react to cyberbullying and what they are leaving online for people like college admission officers and employers to see. With Sprint's help, we're asking kids to think, not just about their safety, but about the kind of people they want to be online.' The new content available today includes: 6 Degrees of Information, a video that asks teens to think about the information they share online and how comfortable they are with people finding it. In the video, Matt, an Internet researcher, asks five teens to participate in an experiment where he will try to find out as much as he can about them online in just six clicks. Rescue Run, a new game where players must avoid obstacles while racing to stop their friends from meeting face-to-face with people they first met online. During the game, players receive tips about how to handle requests to meet offline. Tweens can play at NSTeens.org or download the mobile version from the Apple iTunes stores or the Google Play Android store. Stand By or Stand Up?, the first interactive, role-playing comic on NSTeens.org. The comic addresses cyberbullying and engages tweens through a 'choose-your-own-adventure' style of story in which their decisions help shape the comic's outcome. The new content, along with previous Internet-safety games and videos, is available for free at www.NSTeens.org. The site also includes activity cards and discussion guides to help educators and parents engage tweens in a dialogue about the issues. 'Sprint is committed to addressing the impacts of an increasingly connected and mobile society,' said Debby Ballard, director of Community Affairs for Sprint. 'When we see statistics that tell us 95 percent of all teens are online and 80 percent are users of social media sites, we have to pay attention to the potential risks that come along with navigating an expansive online world. At Sprint, we believe it is more important than ever to make sure that our products and services are being used in the safest manner possible, particularly when in the hands of those who may be the most vulnerable. Together with the National Center for Missing & Exploited Children, we provide free resources to educators, parents and young people nationwide so that working, learning and playing online can be a safe experience. ' NCMEC and Sprint launched www.NSTeens.org in 2007. It is part of NCMEC's popular Internet safety resource, NetSmartz Workshop . It is funded as part of Sprint's Internet safety initiative, 4NetSafety , through Sprint's charitable phone-recycling program, Sprint Project Connect. 4NetSafety is an important part of Sprint Good Works, an initiative that encompasses Sprint's community and philanthropic outreach across the country.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " DALLAS, Aug. 8, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- There's a lot more to Hollywood magic than smoke and mirrors popular movie and TV shows about zombies, superheroes, spaceships and true crime only come to life because of science, technology, engineering and math . To view the multimedia assets associated with this release, please click: http://www.multivu.com/mnr/54048-texas-instruments-stem-behind-hollywood-program-with-mayim-bialik That's why Texas Instruments is launching 'STEM Behind Hollywood,' an exciting new education program developed with assistance from The Science & Entertainment Exchange, a program of the National Academy of Sciences, as well as actress, neuroscientist and STEM education advocate Mayim Bialik. Aimed at getting middle and high school students excited about STEM subjects and careers, 'STEM Behind Hollywood' makes math and science come to life in a series of free online classroom activities available at www.stemhollywood.com that help teachers demonstrate the real-world concepts behind four popular Hollywood themes: Zombies, Space, Superheroes and Forensics. Each activity can be downloaded to the TI-Nspire CX graphing calculator, Student Software or TI-Nspire Apps for iPad, allowing students to visualize and interact directly with sci-fi influenced representations of the math and science to gain a deeper understanding of the real-world concepts. 'We are helping teachers draw young people into STEM by showing the 'cool factor' of real-life science and math behind the magic they see in movies and on TV,' said Melendy Lovett, president of Texas Instruments Education Technology. 'We are very excited to work with The Science & Entertainment Exchange and our STEM education brand ambassador Mayim Bialik on this initiative to capture students' imaginations and cultivate a lifelong interest in STEM subjects and careers.' These activities were developed with the help of scientists and experts from The Science & Entertainment Exchange who consult on Hollywood films and TV shows to ensure the accuracy of science and mathematics depicted on screen. And Bialik, who is not only the Emmy-nominated actress portraying a scientist on The Big Bang Theory but is also a scientist in real life, helps students make the connection between what they see on screen and real concepts. 'The Science and Entertainment Exchange is a nonprofit outreach of the National Academy of Sciences that brings scientists and entertainers together to make the movie magic as realistic as possible,' said Rick Loverd, Program Director of The Science & Entertainment Exchange. 'When entertainers have questions about anything from robotics to physics to genetics as they're making feature films, TV and videogames, we'll bring in field experts who can help them develop whole worlds and characters and stories with real science behind them. One of our goals of this effort is to inspire the next generation of kids into STEM careers, and Texas Instruments' approach to getting kids engaged in math and science by using Hollywood as an entry point, it's really exciting.' In the first activity, Zombies, Bialik teams up with Steven C. Schlozman, PhD, Harvard Medical School professor and renowned author of 'The Zombie Autopsies: Secret Notebooks from the Apocalypse,' to help students explore several real-life scenarios of math and science including what factors would impact the outbreak and spread of a 'zombie pandemic,' much like the plot of the summer's blockbuster film World War Z, and what a 'zombie brain' teaches about a real, healthy human brain's functions. 'It's important to know zombies aren't real but that doesn't mean we can't think out loud in the classroom about what makes them sick and have teachable moments with students on epidemiology and neurology,' said Dr. Schlozman. 'This first activity takes scary, real-life scenarios like avian flu or Ebola outbreaks and turns it into something we can talk about and have some fun with, while still learning and exploring some very serious science concepts.' In addition to Zombies, 'STEM Behind Hollywood' activities will feature themes of Space, Superheroes and Forensics with the help of noted field experts, including: Space: Dr. Randii R. Wessen, Senior Technical Staff at the Jet Propulsion Lab Innovation Foundry Superheroes: Jim Kakalios, PhD, University of Minnesota professor, author of The Physics of Superheroes, and Exchange consultant for Watchmen and Green Lantern Forensics: Diane L. France, Ph.D., D-ABFA, Forensic Anthropologist and Director of the Human Identification Laboratory of ColoradoTeachers, students and parents can visit www.stemhollywood.com to learn more about the 'STEM Behind Hollywood' program, access the free activities, and sign up to receive notifications when new activities are available.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " SEATTLE---- U.S. District Court Judge William H. Orrick has rejected Apples attempt to disqualify intellectual property law firm Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP from representing Flatworld Interactives, LLC in a patent lawsuit alleging that Apples devices infringe patents relating to touchscreens. Apple leveled a series of accusations again Hagens Berman, including a charge that an attorney working for a firm employed by Apple passed confidential information to Hagens Berman attorneys. The company and its attorneys asked the judge to disqualify Hagens Berman from representing Flatworld in its lawsuit due to an alleged conflict of interest. In his ruling, handed down Aug. 7, 2013, Judge Orrick dismissed this claim among others concluding that Hagens Berman did not receive confidential information from McAleese that enabled it to gain an advantage in the litigation. Apple concocted a witchs brew of allegations, comprised of half-truths, conjecture and leaps of dubious logic, said Steve Berman, managing partner of Hagens Berman. We are grateful that Judge Orrick saw the claims for what they were and dismissed them. Berman noted that his firm will seek a Rule 11 sanction, which allows a court to punish attorneys who submit pleadings that contain frivolous arguments. We told Apple that the claims were without merit, illustrated that to them in our pleading and told them if they persisted, we would seek sanctions, and that is what intend to do, Berman said. Berman also noted that since the ruling, Apple has hired another firm to join its already large legal team in defending the claim. We have gone toe-to-toe with Apple and bested them at each turn, he said. We dont believe that adding a hundred additional attorneys will make a whit of difference; the facts of the case will carry the day. Apples motion came just before a crucial Markman hearing, in which the terms in the patent would be construed by the judge. More information about this case is available at http://www.hb-ip.com/our-work/Apple About Hagens Berman Seattle-based Hagens Berman Sobol Shapiro LLP represents inventors, workers, whistleblowers, investors and consumers in complex litigation.

"title": "Pressing Forward: GE Appliances Expands Cooking Products Operation in LaFayette, Ga.", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " Expansion is result of GEs $88 million investment in new product manufacturing Huge new press allows more insourcing of metal parts New GE products/investment adds 90 jobs LOUISVILLE, Ky.---- Today, GE Appliances leaders, joined by Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal and Sen. Johnny Isakson, cut the ribbon on the new plant expansion at GEs cooking products plant in LaFayette, Ga.* The expansion accommodates a new 1,100 ton power press that will enable the plant to increase its metal fabrication capability as part of a program to insource metal parts to support the manufacturing of a new line of wall ovens. Insourcing and new product production have led to the creation of 90 new jobs at the LaFayette plant. The plant expansion accommodates a new 1,100 ton power press that will enable the plant to increase its metal fabrication capability as part of a program to insource metal parts to support the manufacturing of a new line of wall ovens. GE Appliances invested $88 million to support the new line of GE wall ovens and to update the freestanding range products manufactured at the plant, all of which will feature new styling and appearance. The investment is part of a $1 billion investment GE Appliances is making to revitalize its U.S. plants, products and services. So far, the $1 billion investment has created over 3,000 jobs. GE's investment has had a positive impact on the LaFayette economy. We employed more than 40 local companies in our expansion project. The community and our employees can be proud of the innovative, new products built in LaFayette. They will delight consumers across the nation, said GE Appliances President and CEO Chip Blankenship. The LaFayette production expansion is a perfect example of insourcing the manufacturing of products currently made in other countries, said Deal. GEs investment not only provides inroads toward future growth, but it also creates jobs and fosters a sense of pride among local employees who are making industry-first GE appliance products. I congratulate GE today on its expansion in LaFayette and applaud the companys commitment to grow manufacturing plants in the United States, said Isakson. GEs forward-thinking initiatives have brought about new products, ensuring continued development and jobs in Georgia. I am pleased to celebrate with the employees of GE and residents of LaFayette today.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " CHICAGO, Aug. 8, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Pandora Media, Inc. , Ford Motor Co. , SIRIUS XM Radio Inc. , Apple Inc. and Monsanto Company . Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free. Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog: Rising Demand for Pandora in U.S. Pandora Media, Inc. continues to gain popularity in the U.S. on the back of solid growth of Internet radio listeners. The launch of innovative products and services coupled with improving car sales has resulted in such robust growth. Based in Oakland, CA, Pandora provides Internet radio services in the U.S. Recently, Pandora Media reported key audience metrics for the month of July, wherein hours listened to Pandora music increased 14% to 1.28 billion hours from the prior-year period. Moreover, active audience for the month was 71.2 million, up 30% year over year. Such massive growth of listeners has driven the company's share of in the total U.S. radio audience to 7.08% against 6.13% in the same month last year. During the second quarter of 2014, the total audience listening to Pandora music was 3.88 billion as compared with 3.3 billion in same period last year, while average active listeners during the same period was 71.03 million against 54.9 million in the second quarter of 2013. To tap the automobile market, Pandora is continuously forming strategic partnerships with automobile companies as people usually listen to music while driving. Pandora started with radio system installation in Ford Motor Co. in 2010 and has already installed it in more than 100 vehicles. The company believes that the current fiscal year will be profitable as it expects at least 33% of the total cars sold in the country to have Pandora radios. Two months back, Pandora introduced a new service through which people can listen to radio at home through multiple devices. Through tv.pandora.com one can easily connect any gaming consoles or TV to listen to music. Hence, we believe that such strategic moves undertaken by the company will not only boost its Pandora fan base but will also help the company to take an unprecedented lead over popular radio service providers like SIRIUS XM Radio Inc. and Apple Inc. . Apple Inc.'s upcoming iTunes online radio service will offer hands-free voice control in automobiles. Currently, Pandora has a Zacks Rank #3 . Monsanto Hikes Dividend 14.7% Monsanto Company , an agricultural products manufacturer, has recently announced a quarterly dividend hike. The company will be utilizing its free cash to boost stakeholders' returns. The company raised its quarterly dividend by 14.7% to 43 cents from 37.5 cents a share . The increased dividend will be paid on Oct 25, 2013, to shareholders of record as of Oct 4. This is the fourth dividend hike by Monsanto since 2010, which has resulted in a cumulative increase of roughly 60%. Monsanto last hiked its quarterly dividend to 37.5 cents from 30 cents in Aug 2012, reflecting an increase of 25%. Monsanto has been rigorously taking steps to increase shareholders' values. In June this year, the company announced a $2.0 billion share repurchase program, spread over three years. The company's commitment toward increasing shareholders' returns reflects its free cash flow-generating capability, sound liquidity position and defined future prospects. Monsanto boasts a strong balance sheet, with cash and cash equivalents of $2.9 billion, exiting the third quarter of fiscal 2013. The company expects to generate high cash flow of $1.8 billion to $2.0 billion for full fiscal 2013. Looking ahead, the company remains confident of its growth potential, suggesting enhanced value for shareholders. We expect Monsanto to benefit from the rise in the corn seed portfolio pricing in fiscal 2014, leading to higher revenues. Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations.

To access the conference call, dial +1-877-317-6789 for callers in the U.S. and +1-412-317-6789 for international callers and provide the operator with the conference identification number 10031474. A live webcast will be available in the Investor Relations section of the company's corporate web site at www.shoretel.com and an archived recording will be available beginning approximately two hours after the completion of the call until the company's announcement of its financial results for the next quarter. An audio telephonic replay of the conference call will also be available beginning at approximately 4:00 p.m. Pacific Time today until approximately 6:00 a.m. Pacific Time on August 16, 2013 by dialing +1-877-344-7529 or +1-412-317-0088 for International callers and providing the conference identification number 10031474. Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures ShoreTel reports all required financial information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States , but it believes that evaluating its ongoing operating results may be difficult to understand if limited to reviewing only GAAP financial measures. Many investors have requested that ShoreTel disclose this non-GAAP information because it is useful in understanding the company's performance as it excludes non-cash charges, other non-recurring adjustments and related tax adjustments, that many investors feel may obscure the company's true operating performance. Likewise, management uses these non-GAAP measures to manage and assess the profitability of its business and does not consider stock-based compensation charges and amortization charges related to acquisition-related intangible assets, which are non-cash charges, or other non-recurring items in managing its core operations. ShoreTel has provided a reconciliation of non-GAAP financial measures following the text of this press release. Investors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measure. Legal Notice Regarding Forward-Looking Statements ShoreTel assumes no obligation to update the forward-looking statements included in this release.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " JERSEY CITY, N.J., Aug. 9, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- ANTENNA, the authority on enterprise mobility, today announced it has been positioned by Gartner, Inc. in the 'Leaders' quadrant of the Magic Quadrant for Mobile Application Development Platforms for the second consecutive year. Antenna is the only company listed in the report that has been positioned as a leader in mobile application platform Magic Quadrants four out of the last five years.[i] Antenna's positioning by Gartner is based on its completeness of vision and ability to execute. The company also believes it is a reflection of its agility both from a product and company standpoint. As the mobile channel has become more of a strategic priority for businesses in recent years, Antenna has continually evolved its products and services in anticipation of growing market demand and more rigorous enterprise requirements. Since 1998 Antenna has helped companies mobilize their business, and with the most recent version of AMPchroma, the company's flexible and scalable mobility Platform-as-a-Service, it is easier than ever for global 1000 organizations to build and manage mobile applications with Antenna. According to the report, 'Selecting mobile application development platforms has become an urgent issue for many CIOs. Less than seven years after the introduction of Apple's iPhone, the worldwide installed base of smartphones and tablets will surpass that of PCs in 2013. As a result, mobile technologies ranked as a top technology priority in Gartner's last three annual CIO surveys. Building mobile applications is an important component of an enterprise's mobile strategies, because applications provide much of the potential business return on investments in mobile infrastructure. Enterprises build mobile websites and apps to engage customers wherever they are. Similarly, they build mobile applications to improve employee efficiency and effectiveness. However, selecting a MADP is not easy.'[ii] 'Last year we witnessed a true sea change in the enterprise mobility marketplace with a flood of both large and small companies entering the red-hot mobile applications market. Gartner has the unenviable task of sifting through this large and complex ecosystem and helping its clients identify the right partner for the right job,' said Jim Hemmer, president and CEO of Antenna Software. 'We are thrilled that the firm has once again recognized Antenna as a leader in its MADP market assessment, and we believe this cements our understanding of an ever-changing market, and our ability to deliver a flexible, end-to-end mobile platform that enterprises want and need.'

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " LONDON, August 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- We asked 500 of our students two simple questions: where do you study with EF Englishtown now, and where would you like to learn? Answers to the first question weren't that surprising: 70% currently studied at home, 15% in bed and 12% managed to study at work. However, when we asked where our students would like to do their studying, the responses changed dramatically. They ranged from the pragmatic - 30% want to study on their way to work and 21% on a plane - to the exotic: 30% want to study on a lounge chair on a beach in the Maldives and 20% whilst relaxing on a slow boat. Especially creative responses included the desire to study in the Tibetan mountains, at Times Square or the Grand Canyon and, well, on the moon! Learning on public transport and beyond: the world is your oyster The common denominator, whether the answer was practical or aspirational is that people want to fit learning around their lifestyles. Now they can. Today EF Englishtown is launching an Android tablet app to complement the existing EF Efekta 13 iPad app launched in 2012. There are a lot of language learning apps on the market, but ours is different. It isn't just courseware, it includes teacher-led classes that set us apart from our competitors and help students to communicate at a much quicker rate. The app also functions online or offline so progress isn't interrupted when you go through a tunnel, when the seat belt sign comes on or when you've managed to get away from it all to a truly remote location like Mount Everest base camp! If this story piques your interest, why not see what all the fuss is about? If you would like a free trial of the app, simply email EFEnglishtown.Press@ef.com and we will set you up. It's EF Englishtown, and it's based wherever you are. The Android tablet App launches today. About EF Englishtown EF Englishtown is the world's largest and most trusted online English school.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " DUBLIN---- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the 'Global Data Center VOD Market 2012-2016' report to their offering. The analysts forecast the Global Data Center Video on Demand market to grow at a CAGR of 13.87 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the increasing demand for HD programming and on-demand content. The Global Data Center VOD market has also been witnessing innovation in server technology. However, inefficient streaming of VOD content due to limited bandwidth could pose a challenge to the growth of this market. The key vendors dominating this space include ARRIS Group Inc., Concurrent Computer Corp., Dell Inc., EMC Corp., Harmonic Inc., Harris Corp., HP Co., IBM Corp., NetApp Inc., and SeaChange International Inc. The other vendors mentioned in this report are Alcatel-Lucent SA, Apple Inc., Blinkbox, Cisco Systems Inc., Comcast Corp., Edgeware, Espial Group Inc., Fujitsu Ltd., Google Inc., Grass Valley USA LLC, Huawei Technologies Co. Ltd., Hulu.com, LOVEFiLM.com, Motorola Mobility Inc., Netflix Inc., Panasas Inc., RGB Networks, Thomson Video Networks, Verizon FIOS, and ZTE Corp.

Netflix and LoveFilm offer unlimited online streaming videos for a subscription of a few dollars a month. Users can also rent unlimited DVDs per month for a very low subscription. Moreover, games on-demand has a very strong growth potential. The set-top box is becoming popular, and operators have started to cover games in their packages. According to the report, one of the main factors driving the market is the increase in number of smart devices. Innovation in devices, tablets, smartphones and connected TVs has led to an increase in the demand for on-demand videos in the market.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " SAN DIEGO, Aug. 12, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- As the school year quickly approaches, the task of back to school shopping falls to parents everywhere. In today's technology-ruled world, shopping lists no longer center on a new set of colored pencils: smartphones and tablets are the new necessity for back to school, causing parents to think about ways to protect their investment. Kids are permanently attached to their electronics - but far too many have experienced that heart-sinking moment when their device falls into the toilet between classes, gets caught up in a soda spill over lunch, or is dropped down the stairs during a mad dash to football practice. With so many devices lost to split second accidents, it's a good idea to protect them from the unexpected: drinks, food, dirt and drops. With LifeProof cases for both Apple and Android, parents can feel confident sending their student back to school with the latest and greatest smartphone or tablet, knowing that their investment is safe in the classroom, on campus and everywhere in between. Note: LifeProof cases do not provide protection against middle school heartbreaks, teenage emotional outbursts or college headaches. Not only do LifeProof cases provide ultimate protection from cafeteria tray disasters and pep rally catastrophes, but do so in style with cases both parents and kids can agree on. Three-time winner of the Parent Tested Parent Approved Seal of Approval Award, LifeProof offers colors and styles to suit even the fussiest fashionista.

"title": "Amazon Web Services Makes Mobile App Development Easier with Amazon SNS Mobile Push", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " New cross-platform notification service is a fast, scalable and cost-effective way for mobile apps to proactively keep their users aware of critical events and relevant information SEATTLE---- Amazon Web Services, Inc. , an Amazon.com company , today announced Amazon Simple Notification Service with Mobile Push, a fast, fully managed, cross-platform push notification service in the cloud. With one simple API, application developers can easily send notifications to Apple iOS, Google Android and Kindle Fire devices. All AWS customers can begin using Mobile Push for Amazon SNS at no charge and send up to one million notifications each month for free. After that, customers pay $.50 for every million messages published, and $.50 for every million messages delivered . To learn more about Amazon SNS Mobile Push, visit: http://aws.amazon.com/sns. Supporting push notifications at large scale has been incredibly complicated for mobile app developers. Each popular mobile platform maintains a different free relay service that delivers notifications through persistent connections to devices running the platforms they own. This means that to support millions of users on multiple mobile platforms, developers must integrate with each of these platform-specific relay services, which introduces operational complexity and cost. In addition, the nature of mobile app distribution is such that successful apps can become popular almost overnight, exacerbating these challenges for customers. Many customers tell us they build and maintain their own mobile push services, even though they find this approach expensive, complex and error-prone, said Raju Gulabani, Vice President of Database Services, AWS. Amazon SNS with Mobile Push takes these concerns off the table with one simple cross-platform API, a flat low price and a free tier that means many customers wont pay anything until their applications achieve scale. Crittercism is a mobile application performance management company. 'Crittercism helps companies of all sizes monitor their apps performance and identify problems as theyre happening, but quickly communicating to large user bases has always been a challenge for the mobile industry, said Andrew Levy, CEO of Crittercism. AWS services like DynamoDB and now SNS Mobile Push are key building blocks that help us deliver the best experience possible across 600 million mobile devices. SNS Mobile Push means our customers can now notify tens of millions of users in a matter of seconds about critical app performance issues. Urban Airship offers market-leading advanced services for some of the worlds biggest brands to build relationships using push notifications, and Amazon is a key partner for us, said Scott Kveton, CEO of Urban Airship. We've supported push on the Kindle since it first launched, and we employ AWS heavy lifting to support many of our services today. Leveraging AWS allows us to continue to focus on delivering great mobile experiences. The raw transmission of push notifications is itself a heavy workload - AWS has proven it can handle huge-scale workloads. WeatherBug customers expect immediate notification of alerts anywhere in the world, on any platform and on any device,' said Thomas Spendley, Vice President of Engineering of Earth Networks. 'In the past, we built the push service for each specific mobile platform but it was expensive and time-consuming. Amazon SNS with Mobile Push is an easy choice because it is both less expensive than our self-managed service was, and also saves us valuable time that we can reinvest into other priorities. Amazon SNS with Mobile Push can send messages to individual users on specific devices or broadcast identical messages to many subscribers at once, and can easily scale from a few notifications a day to hundreds of millions. Mobile Push is built into Simple Notification Service, which developers already use to notify their customers via SMS text message and e-mail. With Amazon SNS with Mobile Push, developers can focus on engaging their customers instead of the devices those customers happen to choose. Amazon SNS with Mobile Push is available in all public AWS regions. To get started visit: http://aws.amazon.com/sns.

The analysts forecast the Global Education Personal Computer market to grow at a CAGR of 12.08 percent over the period 2012-2016. One of the key factors contributing to this market growth is the need for creative and innovative learning in the Education industry.

However, the shrinking education IT budget could pose a challenge to the growth of this market.

Tablets have changed the way by which teachers interact with their students. Tablets allow storing a large volume of information that a student can have an access to at any time. At a secondary or higher education level, tablets reduce the need for a student to refer to many textbooks for each subject. Moreover, with the increasing number of applications being developed that focuses on the Education vertical, teachers can engage students with interesting educational applications. According to the report, one of the main factors driving the market is the need for creative and innovative learning. In recent times, creativity in the learning process has become extremely essential.

Commenting on the report, an analyst from the team said: The Global Semiconductor Foundry market is witnessing an increasing consolidation and strategic alliances between market players, which are expected to continue even in the future. Both existing vendors and new entrants prefer the acquisitive route to either enter the market or broaden their portfolio of offerings. For instance, Hua Hong NEC Electronics and Grace Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. completed their merger in 2011. In addition, IBM, Global Foundries, and Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. have formed an alliance in the market. Since the market is highly fragmented and competitive, players are adopting strategies such as alliances, agreements, and mergers to sustain the competition. According to the report, one of the main drivers is the restocking of inventory by customers. As the demand for semiconductor devices is increasing, customers are replenishing the stock to keep pace with the current as well as near-future market conditions. For the past few years, this has been one of the major contributing factors to the growth of the market.

"title": "Snap Interactive Reports Results For The Quarter Ended June 30, 2013", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " NEW YORK, Aug. 14, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Snap Interactive, Inc. , a leading social dating developer, today announced financial and operational results for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. On a sequential basis, total revenues for the second quarter of 2013 decreased 9% to $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2013 from $3.5 million for the first quarter of 2013; On a sequential basis, bookings for the second quarter of 2013 increased 5% to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2013 from $3.0 million for the first quarter of 2013, marking the Company's first increase in bookings since the first quarter of 2012; Total revenues decreased 40% to $3.2 million for the second quarter of 2013 from $5.2 million for the comparable period in 2012; Quarterly bookings decreased 42% to $3.1 million for the second quarter of 2013 from $5.3 million for the comparable period in 2012; Net loss was $1.5 million, or $0.04 per basic and diluted common share for the second quarter of 2013 as compared with a net loss of $1.0 million, or $0.03 per basic and diluted common share, for the comparable period in 2012; Available sources of liquidity totaled $3.0 million at June 30, 2013.'We are excited to report that quarterly bookings for the second quarter of 2013 were up 5% sequentially, when compared to the first quarter of 2013, and only down 42% when compared to the comparable period in 2012. Even more encouraging is that the sequential increase in bookings occurred despite a 16% reduction in advertising and marketing spend for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2013, demonstrating that AYI.com's new social features are resonating with its users and generating increased user engagement. We have seen an increase around the conversion of new users into paying subscribers since the launch of certain social features in March 2013,' said Jon D. Pedersen, Sr., SNAP's Chief Financial Officer. 'Once again, our year-over-year results reflect a significant reduction in advertising and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2013 from the comparable period in 2012, which primarily results in decreased new user acquisition. We reduced our user acquisition from the second half of 2012 through January 2013 as we focused on rebuilding, testing and optimizing the redesigned AYI.com application. As we moved past the transitional phase of the re-launch, bookings began to improve during the first quarter of 2013, which continued during the second quarter of 2013. Mr. Pedersen continued, 'In addition to the improved core business metrics noted above, there are other developments that we are excited about around managing our expenses moving forward. We recently announced that we completed a data center move that we expect to save the Company approximately $500,000 a year while improving operational flexibility and site performance. We have also continued to execute our hiring plans of assembling a top-notch product and engineering team, with nearly half of our employees being engineers now. With the majority of the team now in place to execute against our product roadmap, we expect our recruiting costs to decrease during the second half of 2013. Recruiting expenses totaled approximately $300,000 during the first half of 2013 and nearly $600,000 during 2012. We plan to redeploy that cost savings toward user acquisition and marketing to seek to grow our revenue during the second half of 2013 and beyond.' Financial Highlights Three Months Ended Six Months Ended June 30, June 30, GAAP Results 2013 2012 Change 2013 2012 Change Total revenues $ 3,151,989 $ 5,212,637 % 6,621,549 10,958,088 % Advertising and marketing expense $ 952,248 3,023,656 % 2,083,929 7,543,897 % Deferred revenue $ 2,031,702 3,654,943 % 2,031,702 3,654,943 % Net loss $ $ 42 % % Net cash used in operating activities $ 972 % 56 % Non-GAAP Results Bookings $ 3,114,169 $ 5,335,772 % 6,085,683 11,213,482 % Overall liquidity $ 2,992,944 7,200,158 % 2,992,944 7,200,158 % Management Commentary 'During 2012, we made a strategic decision to focus on investing in new hires and talent to support the long-term growth of the redesigned AYI.com, which is built around connecting via users' friends and interests. As we went through the transitional period, we purposely limited advertising and marketing expense,' said SNAP's President and Chief Executive Officer Clifford Lerner. 'Overall advertising and marketing expense for the second quarter of 2013 remained substantially lower compared to the comparable period in 2012, resulting in declines in revenues, bookings and subscribers. Although a correlation exists between revenue and advertising and marketing expense, our revenue for the second quarter of 2013 declined only 40% while our advertising and marketing expense declined 69% versus the comparable period in 2012. We're excited to see our long-term vision begin to take hold since we've launched the new social-based features. This is most evidenced by the 5% sequential growth in bookings for the second quarter of 2013 as compared to the first quarter of 2013, despite a 16% reduction in advertising and marketing expense when comparing such periods.' 'The AYI product's new feature-set, which leverages a user's social and interest graph to better connect people, has been a key driver of improving AYI.com's core metrics and user conversion rates. In additional to the increased conversion of new users to paying subscribers, we're also seeing increased messaging between users when users have friends and interests in common. Perhaps the most exciting data point since the re-launch, is that women in particular are embracing the social-based features. Women are more than twice as likely to contact a man when there is a friend in common, and 36% more likely to contact a man when she shares a common interest.' 'We have also taken other steps to improve our internal analytics and user engagement and conversion,' Lerner continued, 'We completed several new initiatives during the first quarter, including a deeper integration of Splunk to enable more real-time and granular analytics around user engagement and conversion rates. In addition, we made a number of organizational changes that enabled us to focus on improving specific user engagement metrics and prepared us for future growth, For example, we now have a team dedicated to optimizing existing features and testing new ideas. The impact of these changes was only partially realized during the second quarter of 2013, but we expect to experience the full positive impact during the remainder of 2013. Mr. Lerner concluded, 'As we move forward we will continue to focus on increasing conversion, tightly controlling fixed costs and growing the brand around the success of our social-based dating features. With the core feature set around friends and interests fully integrated into the experience, the data is showing that AYI.com is specifically filling a need for single women, as on-site engagement from women is higher when there are friends and interests in common with another user. As a result, we are as excited as ever about our future as we move into the second half of 2013.'

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " NEW YORK, Aug. 14, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Network-1 Security Solutions, Inc. today announced financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2013. Network-1 had revenue of $1,907,000 and $5,971,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2013, respectively, as compared with revenue of $1,966,000 and $ 6,391,000 for the three and six months ended June 30, 2012, respectively.

Network-1 continues to review potential patent acquisitions and strategic relationships with third parties to monetize their patents. 'It was another strong quarter for Network-1,' commented Corey M. Horowitz, Chairman and CEO of Network-1. 'Importantly, during this quarter we acquired a patent portfolio from Mirror Worlds, LLC which has significant licensing potential and at the same time continued to develop our content recognition patent portfolio acquired during the first quarter. Combined with our ongoing Remote Power Patent licensing initiatives, we are strongly positioned for continued growth in our overall technology licensing activities,' he added. During the quarter, Network -1 initiated patent litigation against several vendors of document system software and computer systems in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division, for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 6,006,227 . Named as defendants in the lawsuit are Apple, Inc., Microsoft, Inc., Hewlett-Packard Company, Lenovo Group Ltd., Lenovo, Inc., Dell, Inc., Best Buy Co., Inc., Samsung Electronics America, Inc. and Samsung Telecommunications America L.L.C.

The lawsuit alleges that that the Defendants have infringed and continue to infringe the claims of the '227 Patent by selling and offering to sell Mac OS and Windows operating systems as well as personal computers and tablets that include versions of those operating systems. The '227 Patent was among nine patents and five pending patent applications acquired by Network-1, through its newly formed subsidiary, Mirror Worlds Technologies, LLC, from Mirror Worlds, LLC during the quarter. The '227 Patent entitled 'Document Stream Operating System' relates to methods that enable unified search, indexing, displaying and archiving of documents in a computer system. The inventions described in the '227 Patent resulted from the work done by Yale University computer scientist, Professor David Gelernter, and his then graduate student, Dr. Eric Freeman, in the mid-1990s.

Lifestreams is a licensee of the MW Patent Portfolio. In connection with the acquisition of the MW Patent Portfolio, we also acquired an equity interest in Lifestreams. In addition, in July 2013 we made an additional equity investment in Lifestreams and, as part of an amended license agreement with Lifestreams related to the MW Patent Portfolio, we received a warrant to purchase 7.5% of the outstanding common stock of Lifestreams on a fully diluted basis.

"title": "Fitch: Record Breaking Corporate Bond Volume Possible for 2013", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " NEW YORK---- Corporate bond volume thus far this year suggests record issuance for 2013, according to Fitch Ratings. New bonds totaling $547.4 billion were sold from Jan. 1 through July 31 - $220.8 billion of that amount was priced during the second quarter despite June's tapering-induced retreat. The cost of borrowing continues to be a key driver of issuance. Despite talk of rising interest rates, company financing cost remains attractive. Growth in specific sectors also buoyed bond volume. Computers and electronics, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, and energy have been big players this year. Those three sectors accounted for 35% of industrial activity in the first half and have experienced significant growth since early 2010. Borrowing by entities in the computer and electronics sector has expanded 105% ; healthcare and pharmaceuticals is up 64%; and energy 60%. Notably, the speculative-grade component of outstanding energy bonds has grown at a faster rate than the investment-grade portion . The par weighted average coupon of fixed-rate U.S. corporate bonds dropped further to 5.5% at the end of June, from 5.6% at the end of March and 6.0% a year earlier. The 8% year-over-year decline now spans both financial and industrial bonds, with the two broad areas registering average coupons of 5.1% and 5.7%, respectively. Sectors with a strong investment-grade profile have enjoyed even more significant year-over-year declines in their interest costs. These include food, beverage, and tobacco; computers and electronics; healthcare and pharmaceuticals; and industrial/manufacturing. Each saw their average coupon shrink more than 10% over the past year. The volume of financial bond issuance is virtually unchanged from the beginning of the recovery, but Fitch thinks the pace is likely to change. Issuance picked up in July with $34.6 billion sold. Stronger demand for commercial and industrial loans, improved demand for consumer loans and a greater willingness among banks to lend could also propel issuance. Of course, the economy's trajectory in the second half and reaction to the Federal Reserve's policy directives will play a role in just how much companies are willing to borrow from investors, but given the trends noted above, we believe corporate bond volume could break a record this year.

"title": "Honeywell Helps Retailers Get Mobile With New Scanning And Payment Accessories For iPod Touch And iPhone 5 Mobile Devices", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " FORT MILL, S.C., Aug. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- A recent study on shopping behaviors confirmed what most know instinctively: it's no fun to wait in line at check out, and three out of four shoppers say this is what they hate most about shopping . Honeywell today announced two new tools for retailers to shorten check out times and make shopping more personalized for customers and store owners. Honeywell's Captuvo SL42 and SL22 are encasements for the Apple iPhone 5 and fifth generation iPod Touch mobile digital devices, respectively, turning the consumer devices into selling tools that allow retail workers to look up inventory, scan barcodes and securely process payment, bringing the check out to the shopper so no one has to wait in line. Both new products feature Honeywell Adaptus 6.0 imaging technology, which accurately reads virtually any bar code, including coupons or loyalty club bar codes increasingly found on the reflective screens of mobile devices. 'Mobile POS enablers like our Captuvo line are quickly changing the way customers and stores do business, and you will continue to see innovation from Honeywell in this area,' said Peter Fehl, vice president of global marketing for Honeywell Scanning & Mobility. 'What sets apart Honeywell devices is our technology with the industry's best scanning capability, security features and durability.' Scanning performance, durability and ease-of-use were key factors that led executives from Sportsman's Warehouse to equip workers in each of its 46 stores with the Captuvo SL22 for iPod Touch mobile digital devices. The company's big-box stores across the United States are a one-stop shop for outdoors enthusiasts, selling sporting goods, clothing, footwear and supplies to campers, fishers and hunters. 'The Honeywell Captuvo SL22 is a great fit for our low-key shopping environment: it extends our workers' product and inventory expertise, and is much easier for customers and our workers to use than a traditional aisle-based check-out lane,' said Mike Van Orden, chief technology officer for Sportsman's Warehouse. 'And because it's based on the Apple iOS, our employees already are familiar with the user interface, so there is very little training needed, even for temporary or seasonal help.' The Captuvo SL22 is now shipping, and the SL42 will ship this month. The first generation Captuvo SL22 sled for iPod Touch 4 was released in July 2012.

"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " CHICAGO, Aug. 15, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include Qualcomm Inc. , Apple Inc. , Google Inc. , Microsoft Corp. and Elizabeth Arden, Inc. . Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free. Here are highlights from Wednesday's Analyst Blog: Qualcomm Remains Neutral We reiterate our long-term Neutral recommendation on Qualcomm Inc. . The company reported strong financial results for the third quarter of fiscal 2013, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate. Qualcomm currently has a Zacks Rank #3 . Why Kept at Neutral? We believe that Qualcomm will continue to perform well due to a significant surge in the demand for smartphones and tablets. Management has raised its outlook for fiscal 2013 and is quite confident that it will be able to retain its current rate of revenue and earnings growth, going forward. We believe that the long-term fundamentals of the company remain intriguing given the increasing demand for LTE-enabled mobile handsets in the developed countries, rapid transition from 2G to 3G and 4G in China and India and increasing licensing revenues. Qualcomm has a very healthy cash position, helping it to undertake several R&D activities for the next-generation products. Qualcomm is a major chipset supplier to Samsung, which is currently the largest seller of smartphones globally and a major chipset supplier to Apple Inc. for its popular iPhones. Google Inc. has decided to use Snapdragon processor for its latest Nexus 7 tablets. Qualcomm has been favored by the Windows 8 operating system of Microsoft Corp. . During the third quarter of fiscal 2013, Qualcomm shipped 172 million MSM chipsets, up 22% year over year. This figure was far better than the company's guidance of a mid-point of 168 million. Average selling price of mobile handsets with an in-build Qualcomm chipset during this quarter was around $227-$233. This sequential increase registered a substantial hike of $13 from the last quarter's mid-point. Nevertheless, the ongoing global economic volatility may severely impact the telecommunications industry, which in turn may negatively affect the demand for Qualcomm developed chipsets. Qualcomm's future growth depends on the continuous deployment of CDMA/OFDMA-based network technologies. If the emerging markets fail to maintain the current rate of installing high-speed 3G, next-generation 4G or any hybrid 3G-4G wireless networks, the demand for smartphones will decline, which will affect Qualcomm's financials. Elizabeth Arden Downgraded to Strong Sell Zacks Investment Research downgraded Elizabeth Arden, Inc. to a Zacks Rank #5 on Aug 13, following dismal fourth-quarter and fiscal 2013 results announced last week. Why the Downgrade? Elizabeth Arden has witnessed sharp downward estimate revisions after reporting lower-than-expected fourth quarter and fiscal 2013 results. Shares of this makeup and skin care company crashed after the announcement and given its weak outlook for the upcoming fiscal year it has more downside left. On Aug 8, Elizabeth Arden reported fiscal fourth-quarter earnings per share of 10 cents, missing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 68.8% and the year-ago earnings by 64.3% due to lower revenues and poor margins. Revenues rose only 0.8% to $267.9 million and missed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $289 million. The fiscal 2013 earnings and revenues also missed the Zacks Consensus Estimates and fell short of the company's expectations. The company's growth expectations for the Elizabeth Arden brand one of the most widely recognized beauty brands in the world proved to be too optimistic leading the company to perform below expectations in the year. Additionally, lower-than-expected orders from one of the largest North American mass retail customers and a weak performance in Europe, especially in the U.K., pulled down revenues in both fourth quarter and fiscal 2013. In addition, Elizabeth Arden issued a relatively weak outlook for fiscal 2014. For full year 2014, sales are expected to grow between 3.0% and 5.0% year over year, much lower than the growth seen in fiscal 2013. Earnings are expected in the range of $2.15 to $2.30, representing approximately 4% growth at the mid-point. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2014 decreased a sharp 22.1% to $2.19 per share over the last 7 days as all the estimates were revised downwards. Estimates for fiscal 2015 went down 23.6% over the same timeframe. Today, Zacks is promoting its ''Buy'' stock recommendations. Get #1Stock of the Day pick for free.

"title": "OtterBox Earns Another Victory Against Counterfeiters", 
"source": "CNBC", 
"content": " FORT COLLINS, Colo.---- OtterBox, maker of premium protective cases for mobile technology, has won another battle in the ongoing war against counterfeiters. A U.S. District Court judge recently issued a permanent injunction against a New York-based company and ordered it to pay OtterBox $2 million related to the sale of counterfeit cases. The court found that S & P Trading Inc. violated provisions of the Lanham Act when it purchased and then sold no less than 146,025 counterfeit cases, infringing on federally registered trademarks for which OtterBox owns all rights. This is the latest judgment in a series of actions OtterBox has taken to protect its brand. Counterfeit consumer product goods continue to be a drain on the global economy. Last year, the Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized counterfeit goods totaling $1.26 billion in retail value.* Like so many other premium consumer brands, OtterBox aggressively fights against intellectual property theft. OtterBox was built on bringing our customers innovative, first-to-market products, said OtterBox CEO Brian Thomas. A lot of design, engineering and testing goes into each of our custom protective cases, which is why we take a hard line with companies creating and selling fake cases, as well as those infringing on our patents and trademarks. Counterfeit products damage our reputation for delivering premium quality products because many consumers arent aware that they purchased a fake OtterBox. If a deal seems to be too good to be true, it probably is. OtterBox currently has more than 110 trademark registrations worldwide with several pending. Additionally, the company holds more than 190 patents in the U.S., placing it among the top innovators in the wireless communications space just between Apple Inc. and BlackBerry. In 2012, OtterBox, in collaboration with CBP, confiscated more than 118,000 counterfeit items and was awarded judgments and settlements totaling nearly $11 million. About OtterBox: Starting with something as simple as a box, OtterBox was founded in 1998 with a line of indestructible dryboxes. Today, OtterBox is the No. 1-selling case for smartphones** and offers an extensive lineup of premium screen protectors and other device-enhancing accessories that complement various consumer lifestyles. OtterBoxs strong relationships with the leading mobile device manufacturers, retailers and wireless services providers delivers unrivaled value, world-class customer service and a continued commitment to premium product quality. OtterBox has been a five-time honoree on the Inc. 5000 ranking of fastest growing private companies in the U.S., recognized by Forbes Magazine on Americas Most Promising Companies and is a repeat honoree in the Great Place to Work annual survey published by FORTUNE Magazine. The family-owned, private company has global headquarters in Fort Collins, Colo. and offices in Boston, San Diego, Cork, Ireland and Hong Kong. For more information, visit otterbox.com.

"content": " Kamarul Akhir | AFP | Getty Images US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel speaks at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur on August 25, 2013 The Pentagon is prepared to carry out military options on Syria should President Barack Obama order them, U.S. Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said on Sunday. Hagel echoed White House statements cautioning that America was still gathering the facts about the Syrian government's alleged use of poison gas against civilians. But he noted that the U.S. military, which is repositioning its naval forces in the Mediterranean to give Obama the option for an armed strike, was ready to act if asked. Did Syria cross red line? NBC's Steve Handelsman reports critics in Washington are complaining that President Obama's delay of any U.S. military response is giving Syria a green light to use weapons again. Ahmed Shihab-Eldin, Huffington Post; Avik Roy, Manhattan Institute; and Mark Simone, WOR radio talk show host, share their opinions on what they want President Obama to do. 'President Obama has asked the Defense Department to prepare options for all contingencies. We have done that and we are prepared to exercise whatever option - if he decides to employ one of those options,' Hagel told reporters at a news conference in Kuala Lumpur. American and European security sources have said U.S. and allied intelligence agencies made a preliminary assessment that chemical weapons were used by Syrian forces in the attack. The United Nations has requested access to the site. Hagel, whose week-long trip to Asia is being overshadowed by Syria tensions, participated remotely in a meeting on Saturday that Obama held with his top military and national security advisers to hash out options on Syria. Asked whether, after that meeting, he was personally convinced chemical weapons had been used in Syria, Hagel said: 'We, along with our allies, are continuing to assess the intelligence, and the specifics of that intelligence, on the use chemical weapons.' 'I wouldn't go any further than that until we have more intelligence, based on facts,' he said. Obama has been reluctant to intervene in Syria's civil war, but reports of the killings near Damascus have put pressure on the White House to make good on the president's comment a year ago that chemical weapons would be a 'red line' for the United States. Hagel did not enter into detail about what options the United States was weighing, but noted that any scenario carried risks. He noted on his flight to Malaysia that if Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's forces intentionally used chemical weapons, 'there may be another attack coming'. 'There are risks and consequences for any option that would be used -- or not used. For action or inaction,' Hagel said on Sunday. 'All of those assessments are being made. They will be driven by \u007f the facts, what our intelligence assessment produces, law, legal issues, international support.' "
